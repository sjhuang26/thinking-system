I have developed an end-to-end psychological organization.

First principles are descriptions of the partly innate and partly acquired aspects of the rationality map that rhetoric can convey.

Relational Frame Theory is represented in the top-down brain system, while the prior art of the cognitive map theory is represented in the bottom-up brain system.

1. People need to behave in accordance with a binary signal of rationality (Correct-Incorrect). We explain the lack of impulse control and mental persistence as improper control. Virtually all people live through top-down knee-jerk reactions and very few live from bottom-up rationality. Combinations of experiential exercises such as rationality reflection, ACT therapy deliteralization, and Snaps make practicing this shift feel like "downhill sledding." The rationality network is far more resilient to stress than the token network; therefore, it buffers the psychological risks of the training.
2. The top-down brain system, represented by a CIsrm (Correct-Incorrect Self-Regulation Metaphor), contains a spaghetti mess of relationally associated/entangled tokens, bound by Correct-Incorrect to (1) attention (2) intention (3) knee-jerk reactions. The big purpose, however, is that tokens encode first principles (e.g., rules of technical jargon, rules of specialized notation, rules of formal logic) that allow for reasonably objective communication (everyone has their own viewpoint, and social norms result in particular cases of wildly varying first principles, but the first principles of the first principles are far more similar).
3. In the bottom-up brain system, cognitive maps can be modeled as a "rationality map": (1) originators of rational cognition (2) high-dimensional spaces (3) grid cell networks accessible through conscious and subconscious processes (4) massively organized as a high-dimensional space (5) based on first principles such as those pertaining to self-identity, personal values, ethics, morality, and life experiences, as well as a general set of first principles generally and arbitrarily applicable to constitute an exciting new hypothetical training system of "polymath creativity."
