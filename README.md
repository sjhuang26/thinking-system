# Description of breakthrough cognitive map aptitude training

## Revised Introduction

This essay establishes a terminology of **cognitive maps**.

- One source claims that "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds."
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560
- Relational Frame Theory is framed in terms of the cognitive map.
  - At a young age, the cognitive map self-organizes through nonverbal acquisition of first principles and mental models.
    - Is the approach of Multiple Exemplar Training in Relational Frame Theory the most efficient? In this light, what do we say about the **prior art** of Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in SMART training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ"? [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training; https://raiseyouriq.com]

Can a **training curriculum** be developed to increase **token painting aptitude** -- one's productivity in responding to cues by activating (paying attention to) the right subset of the cognitive map -- and would this increase cognitive intelligence?

Do cognitive maps reflect something fundamental in **psychopathology**? At the very least, virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to put work into better organizing one's cognitive map.

We outline a major difference between two neural circuits: "CPU"* of Reward and Punishment and a "GPU" of Rational Behavior. Does the human self-regulation capacity rest entirely in the GPU -- if so, what if our training philosophy were to force the CPU to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility?

- First circuit: CPU
  - Reward and punishment / operant behavior
    - primary actor in the CPU
    - also, emotional impulsivity
- Second circuit: GPU
  - Rational behavior / cognitive map
    - primary actor in the GPU
    - accounts for operant behavior
  - token painting aptitude
    - as discussed in the ```Big Picture```

*This is an analogy to two major classes of computer processors.

The GPU would create a CORRECT-INCORRECT binary signal of rationality that could overwrite the CPU when trained. This is treated as a **local maxima** of rationality.

### Main takeaway

I think that SMART training supports the hypothesis that **GPU stress leads to positive results in cognitive intelligence aptitude increase**.

However, is SMART training _efficient_ at GPU stress? SMART training takes thousands of repetitions.

We claim that not only does our training have fewer repetitions, it has an advantageous _training timeline_. In ```How to avoid training plateaus?``` we discuss how our training unlocks an _efficient_ process at graduating from **dense** to **sparse** cognitive skills, creating a level of _cognitive control and intuition_ that neither SMART training nor the best prior art in pedagogy does.

### Secondary takeaway

I will address the topic of psychopathology in a future essay. We will address in the future both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and critique their strengths/weaknesses.

## Revised Training

### Terminology

- Different appearances encode different levels of **detail** when visualized.
  - ```cartoony appearance < realistic appearance```
- A training is **dense** (opposite of **sparse**) when details of the cues are easily absorbed. 
  - This frequently occurs in the spatial-visual training context, considering the fast speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained).
  - Episodic memory is pretty dense.
  - Declarative memory is notoriously sparse.
- The **Ebbinghaus asymptote** is a common-sense assumption from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.
  - The present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an **asymptotic** (virtually infinite detail level) episodic memory.
  - To be clear, seeing an image and forgetting 90% of episodic detail between second 1 and second 10 (after assuming similar rates and extrapolating) reasonably implies that second 0.01 must be incredibly dense (thousands to millions of details) and that the density of second 0 must be virtually infinite.
- There is a terminology parallel with Relational Frame Theory.
  - TODO? SAME-DIFF => "portaling"; MORE-LESS => "snowballing"; HIERARCHY => "painting"

### Setup of training exercise

Time to sit in a room and set up the exercise of attention switching between cues and details.

The **portal** procedure will be defined as operating over any two cues (notation: ```&```).

- Cue A.
- Cue B.
- Also consider cue AB.
  - (a visual "merging together" or "melting together" of A/B)
- Also consider cue X.
  - (anything in the room that isn't A or B)

Eventually, you should practice the following portals.

- ```A&B```
- ```X&AB```
- ```AB&A```
- ```AB&B```

### Procedure of training exercise

The portal procedure is defined as a cycle (repeated several times) in a steady **"temporal ping-pong"** rhythm. There is **dual pressure** -- two **detail hierarchies** being proliferated at once.

- **CORRECT-INCORRECT** binary of attention.
  - Label the cue you should pay **attention** to as CORRECT. Label the other cue as INCORRECT.
  - Notice how the INCORRECT cue is unambiguously **anti-attention**.
- From the CORRECT cue, find another random associated detail to point out: this is **"snowballing"** from less detail to more cumulative detail.
  - (detail possibilities: locations of particular lines, shades of color, any associated memory, style of the room, time of day, etc.)
- Switch the CORRECT and INCORRECT cue around.

### Advantage 1: Attention-related interferences are stressed

- paying attention to a cue vs. paying attention to the details hierarchically encoded within the cue
- correct vs. incorrect (in particular, better managing any symbolic reasoning involved).
- not directly specifying which object is Correct versus Incorrect until the last milliseconds and seeing how fast your brain can pay attention / react
- Cue#1 vs. Cue#2

### Advantage 2: Cognitive maps are stressed

- A, B, and X are all episodic memories and also members of the **cognitive map**.
- Crowd A of neurons continues to talk to Crowd B and Crowd X resulting in very strong combinatorial interactions.
  - Details are pulled in pairs (jump to Cue#1, pull a detail, jump to Cue#2, pull another detail).
  - Does this make the training more robust? I don't know.

### Advantage 3: The exercise is far more than a "detail mindfulness habit"

Does our exercise go beyond merely creating a marginal chance of a "random quiz" to get the brain to pay attention? Yes; The exercise as a whole is a massive **signal booster** of attention/reward/punishment.

- The narrow focus (only two cues and the details within them) make the INCORRECT case very specific. This trains a migration of attention between two points (which make a straight line!)
  - This suggests the importance of also practicing memory palace (method of loci) navigation and visualizing "drawing a curved line across the path."
- There is a strong visualization aspect; I believe the "mind's eye" works by storing the delta between the present and the desired visualization.
  - An alternate explanation is that the "mind's eye" works by fluctuating from past (synthesizing the necessary episodic memories) to present.
  - To be clear, I think the GPU is capable of the sensory process of visualization -- simulating the future from the episodic past/present.
- There is an incredibly fast density shift from Cue A to Cue B and back. I strongly suspect the mechanistic manipulation of a "a back-and-forth brain wave rhythm" like "sitting on a rocking chair."
  - Clearly feel that each cue attention shift drops details from the brain. For amplifying this effect, apply **line-diagram notation**.
    - Visually annotate the room with boundaries and curves with lines (like an artist would!).
    - The goal is to preserve as much detail as possible when cues are "copied" into some working memory buffer (e.g., I force myself to color the objects RED and GREEN).

### How to avoid training plateaus? Cycle of deliberate practice, from dense to sparse training

> TODO! Anything in italics is a sophisticated metaphor/construct that requires further explanation.

Modify the input initial cue with DENSE constructs, find two details, and apply the SPARSE portal ```(detail 1 as new cue) & (detail 2 as new cue)```, which the _multiple-document cycle_ tries to resolve.

- _dense constructs_ include:
  - _first principles_
  - _systems analysis_
  - _legalistic constructs_
  - _semi-mnemonics_
- _Thin Client Principle_: the details of dense cues might be a sparse cue
- a _content buffer_ over an extended period of time
- critique of _Krashen Input Hypothesis_

### How to avoid training plateaus? TODO: unorganized tips

> TODO! No guarantee of clear explanation.

I noticed improvement in creativity without implementing even half of these, so a vague understanding of these tips should suffice for the beginner.

- Practice the **CORRECT-INCORRECT binary swap**.
  - if my goal were to label everything incorrectly, and A were correct, labeling A as "correct" is incorrect while labeling A as "incorrect" is correct.
- Build the **cue/stimulus equivalence understanding** of how CUE equals REWARD AND PUNISH equals PHYSICAL OBJECT equals WRAPPER (for hundreds of details).
  - Creating metaphors for reward, punishment, and the cue-detail relationship, clearly understood to be a hierarchy.
    - one cue, many details
    - details can be associated with other details
    - details have subdetails
    - details can turn into new cues
    - details can be shared between multiple cues
    - etc.
- Practice judging correctness based on how **surprising** the difference between the actual case and the anticipated case is.
- Accept that you will have to relearn the **educational constructs** that you learned through rote.
  - You should start thinking in terms of "KWL charts," "hamburger models of essays," and so on.
  - Create metaphors for logical relations and inductions.
    - "NOT" signs
    - "LESS THAN" and "MORE THAN" signs
    - Imagine a bubble that says "NOT (A =/= B)" sprouting from the bubble of "A == B".
  - Create a productive standardized format of data exchange.
    - This is discussed at length in the more advanced or TODO sections?
- Use proper **self-regulation exercises** such as rationality reflection, ACT therapy deliteralization, and Snaps.
  - a feeling that self-regulation is as easy as "downhill sledding"
  - TODO: investigate self-regulation denseness vs. sparseness?
  - TODO: create a comprehensive guide on avoiding "Packer self-blame" and other conscious/subconscious issues?
  - The rationality network is extremely resilient to stress; therefore, it buffers the psychological risks of the training.
    - social norms result in particular cases of wildly varying first principles, but the first principles of the first principles are far more similar; this is the sense of common human identity
- Visualize a **zero cue** which is a small gray-colored sphere that can be colored depending on the position in the formula. Treat it as the top of the **cue hierarchy** -- the Platonic Ideal that all **one cues** (specific cues) descend from.
  - To be clear, the portal formula is: ```0&1```
  - Is mastering the logic of variables equal to mastering logical comparisons between specific objects? Is creativity the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres? Is there a general aptitude of jumping from one sphere to another sphere independent from the first one? The point is to build confidence in the skill generalization.
  - **TODO: This is when we come full circle to the prior art -- the ideas of SMART training -- useful although incomplete.**

### TODO: a list of more formulas for snowballing

> TODO? Practice random-access jumping between a cumulating list of items in a memory palace journey. But also a _Random-Access Stress_ in general. This is the best dense construct available ... TODO?

```
A&AB

0 & 01
1 & 2 => 01 & 012
2 & 3 => 012 & 0123
3 & 4 => 0123 & 01234

involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item" that all other objects originate from

Zero & Zero Question
Zero Question & Zero Question Answer

less detailed item & more detailed item
```

```
Logic A > B means that B < A [see: Relational Frame Theory]
You could visualize this as a two-variable equation
Even jumping from "front of flashcard" to "back of flashcard" is a logic formula of Item1 + Item2
```
