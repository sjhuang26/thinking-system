# Defending the "Mapper-Packer" Dialectic as a Breakthrough Perspective in Applied Psychology

## Introduction

A mapper will "sit and think" about "collect[ed] information" to "simplify" the "mental map" while a packer lacks command of the aforementioned simplifying process. [https://wiki.c2.com/?MappersVsPackers]

We rigorize the dichotomy with speculative neurological circuits so we can deconstruct a long list of psychological phenomena (including core ideas in Relational Frame Theory).

- Packer - Reward and Punishment circuit - CPU
- Mapper - Rationality circuit - GPU

The goal is for the CPU to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility (using, for instance, metaphors), so that:

- wide-ranging psychological effects arise
  - We describe a therapy with the advantages of learnability (easy to learn), simplicity (very few elements), productivity (generally faster results).
  - We demonstrate that a Self-Other Relationship is psychologically necessary {pertains to: existential crisis vs. existential fulfillment; morality; religion}.
  - We examine my documentation of the extreme psychological effects that the therapy has produced in me.
- new opportunities for increasing cognitive intelligence appear
  - We develop a new training to cognitively stress the GPU far more.
  - We argue that the prior art [Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in https://raiseyouriq.com] is fundamentally unworkable.
- Limitation: the CPU stage may be necessary at a very young age to crystallize some "cue/token bubbles" in the GPU.
  - TODO: Packers + tokens; Mappers + GPU contains a subsystem of Packers (rhetoric/ reconciliation process???)
  - TODO: token = locus of attention/behavior

We address the prior art (SMART [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training] training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ") by arguging that their training is fundamentally unworkable* in cognitively stressing the GPU.

- *{I think the training (inefficiently) works because repeating the drills hundreds to thousands of times creates a marginal stress on the GPU.}

## Speculative neurological circuits

CPU >> Emotional Executive:

- root of impulsivity

GPU >> Cognitive map:

- self-organizing cognitive map
- the popular construct of "rationality"
- nonverbal acquisition of first principles
- `systems-analysis.md`
- mental models
- sensory process of visualization; simulating the future from the episodic past/present
- combinatorial generalization >> creative intuition
- principles transclude other principles
- QUOTE ABSTRACT "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560]

GPU >> Self-regulation:

- the goal is for behavior to always meet a binary standard of Correct-Incorrect (CI)
- CI represents the local maxima of rationality
- key differences from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
- `self-regulation.md`

## Outline of a VERY BASIC VERSION of the training

1. Imagine both correct and incorrect.
2. Learn a ton of metaphors.
3. SAME-DIFF teaches "exclusionary attention."
4. MORE-LESS teaches "snowballing."
5. HIERARCHY teaches "painting."

Steps 1/2.

> visualize imagining correctly and then visualize imagining incorrectly. Principle of surprise >> on how cognitively surprising the difference between present and memory is, you should judge the quality of mental recall, instead of doing some habit of operant reinforcement (e.g., self-blame) whether conscious or subconscious

> Educational constructs were learned through rote, requiring you to re-learn a bunch of stuff. For instance, the use of memorizing a "NOT" sign for the NOT relation. A "LESS" sign for the LESS relation. etc. metaphor-ize the relations and other rote understandings; create a productive standardized format of data exchange (Serial Data Code Full Text); base everything off of that home base

> same-different (e.g., hot vs. cold), more-less (e.g., small snowball, big snowball), hierarchy (e.g., zoom in / zoom out)

> for example, in a logic puzzle, the bubble corresponding to "A == B" can be expanded to cause the proliferation of "NOT (A =/= B)" which may subsequently bubble into awareness. This parallels the conventional Relational Frame Theory explanation but does not essentialize the CPU in cognitive thriving.

Steps 3/4/5.

Exclusionary attention as:

1. an interaction between every combinatorial pair of details
2. an interaction between every combinatorial pair of tokens*
3. paying attention to This Thing while being precommitted*2 to One Other Thing
4. a temporal ping-pong between Two Things (two tokens, A and B, rapidly bouncing attention between the two)*3

*{TODO look into fixing this vague formulation of combinatorial reasoning (but avoid the word "combinatorialism"? maybe claim that "generalization" is frequently combinatorial) with the general philosophy of line-diagram notation; also with the general opportunity for temporal ping-pong between combinations}
*2{TODO precommitted?? Reword it to some more Skinnerian language like "motivated to"??}
*3{TODO refactor to checklist?}

Snowballing as:

1. a cumulating series of objects from 0 to 01 to 012, involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item"* that all other objects originate from
2. going from Question to Question+Answer
3. a cumulating sequence of densities

*{TODO This concept, through practical usage, has been heavily rigorized and I need to write my latest findings up (ZPS etc.) and in fact it may reflect an innate curiosity/ pattern-matching tendency that we tap into??}

Neuron networks are hierarchies that:

1. are encapsulated by a token
2. can be painted with a color (RED-GREEN)
3. encode variegated details in various densities of detail*

*{TODO revise the messy definition of density}

`todo.md`

```
Token deconstruction: a major sub-project

- Token<>density<>system

"Decay factor" vs. level of detail = density

- Density fluctuates. DetailA RandomDetailB has poor density (fast decay) while DetailA RelatedDetailB has good density (slow decay)
- The point is that high-density painting is more efficient
- A higher level of detail will always have faster decay ... but the degree of this effect is density.

Unanswered/ Density seems important, like a global factor, but it seems to have a limited local use at best. So what IS density ABOUT at a first principles level?

- Going from really high density to lower to lower to lower density is a deliberate practice style/cycle that is what I am doing right now
```

Token-details hierarchy as:

1. one token encapsulating many details
2. details as being shared by at least one possible token*

*{TODO need to clarify this fuzzy relationship and clarify the operation of hierarchy/painting which is the key generalizable skill}

Density is acted upon by the Ebbinghaus principles of forgetting.

1. The present sensory stream-of-consciousness is an asymptote of virtually infinite density.
2. Conventional episodic memory is worse.
3. Declarative memory is especially low.

> The "Ebbinghaus asymptote" is really important idea of speculative neurological extrapolation

Training context comprises:

1. temporal ping-pong*
2. painting two neuron networks (A and B)*2
3. string together detail within A to detail within B*3
4. practice using a low-density visualization (easier to switch attention) to offload the difficulty of switching attention from one heavy tree of sensory data to another in a high-density, high-pressure situation (e.g., low-density Control Panel, high-density Present Sensory Data, attention switch capability)*4

*{TODO emphasize how temporal ping-pong is a key training element and give concrete example so we are all on the same page with the metaphor}
*2{TODO really create a COMBINED metaphor where neuron networks <> painting <> temporal ping-pong so that we aren't essentializing (colors, neurons, ping-pong games, etc.)}
*3{TODO super vague, need to tie to temporal ping-pong (stringing = temporal ping-pong context)}
*4{TODO Fix this bad explanation. Temporal ping-pong is a sufficient explanation in light of...; Control Panel = hierarchical painting.}

## TODO zone

> In some training contexts (e.g., spatial-visual), it is trivial to absorb massive densities, such that the speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained) is astoundingly fast compared to the declarative memory schemas.
> > TODO visualization ~= GPU (use as EXAMPLE of GPU power!!)

> CPU executive control and CPU attention >> GPU attention. The GPU attention is done by threatening yourself to pay attention properly using a "10% chance" of a random quiz.
> > TODO a way to fuse Skinnerian operant w/curiosity; and another great opportunity of temporal ping-pong (Skinnerian frame vs. curiosity frame)

> (1: weak) Visualization IS the synthesis of prior episodic memories. (2: strong) Temporal ping-pong ~= "mind's eye"?
> > TODO visualization ~= GPU

> The input of the present sensory data can be treated as a particular episodic memory very close to the "Ebbinghaus asymptote."
> > TODO fix "Ebbinghaus asymptote"

> At any point in time, there may exist many representations of the same physical object with wildly varying densities.
> > TODO line-diagram notation

> Present = high. Far past = low. Question AND answer = high. Question = low. Realism = high. Cartoony appearance that is more encodable or memorable = low. Words = really low. Also practice cumulating keeping track of items in a memory palace journey, although the density fluctuation is lower (but it is still worth practicing this). Do the Correct-Incorrect exercises over the densities to suppress the CPU's operants. Hazy visualization, clear visualization, actually visually seeing the object in the present moment. etc.
> > Cartoony appearance = TODO line-diagram notation

> The GPU can do deep-mapping as a density-preserving operation. A strong image (e.g., the Present vision) can be deep-mapped into a strong image of a visualizations (e.g., coloring objects Red/Green/Gray) which can be also encoded in episodic memory. Deep mapping is an important marker of the upper end of the density scale.
> > TODO Emphasize how deep mapping preserves detail in line-diagram notation

## TODO portals

Tokens = painting.
Portals = painting game.
Temporal ping-pong is a GAME OF PORTALS.

Portals are written in ampersand (`&`) notation.

TODO Do portals require ZPS (Zero Point Symmetry) formalism? Probably not ... but SDCFT probably does ...

TODO So portals make creativity first in the cognitive development sequence??? links ... (e.g., a "creative link" between two ideas; e.g. combinatorial temporal ping-pong)

Portals = density practice

- to densities ... (portals are inherently about a gradient of density (low density PORTAL high density) (A PORTAL AB) (0 PORTAL 01, 01 PORTAL 012, 2 PORTAL 012))
- Some densities are "harder" (again, need TODO rigorize) but we need to see that deliberate practice allows moving up from easy to medium to hard; hardness is RELATIVE to BOTH ELEMENTS in the portal!!! (TODO training note)

TODO do portals lead to ZPS formalism directly (0-1 "Zero Point" snowballing step vs. 1-2 snowballing step)?

> Zero Point Symmetry >> as a practical aspect of portals

## TODO SDCFT

Code = Mapper

> First address data-as-code. Code is basically a direct attempt to manipulate the GPU through execution (Mapper), data runs on the token/locus (Packers) and the GPU has a subsystem of MODELING the Packers' behaviors.

> Figure out how Code can run in a way grounded on CI (from a genuine position of rationality, not a fake position of operant)


> Code/ Being able to name a system; "The system of ..."

1. Serial Data Full Text (packers)
2. Code (mappers)

> There is no need to address Full Text ~= UX critique. But we will footnote it.

> There is no need to address the {token-locus/Turing Tape/painting the turing tape~=derived relational response / Chinese Room Argument} but in the end we will footnote both.

- Code means conscious control.

## TODO ZPS

ZPS = the universalism that domain skills in fact reduce to a reasonably small number of major stimulus classes with portals

- NO, the transfer of density through portals is not the cause ... rather, density gets easier over time ... ZPS suggests the mastery of a Platonic ideal "Zero Point" object that generalizes to more specific objects ... there is an "ultimate ideal" (root element)

speculative high dimensional space analogy {mathematics, neurology}

> the number of stimulus classes is very small!!!

> speculative zero-one rotational symmetry diagram of high-dimensional brain spaces; to capture this speculation, `~=` as rotational symmetry of the form (memory/DP = SDFT/C) with side channels pushed to the outside context

> Here is a list of major stimulus classes that a student would find useful. {privilege/ knowledge isn't necessary in the beginning}

TODO practical note: portals can MODEL this process!!!

> e.g. [Relational Frame Theory]/ (ZPa AND ZPb IS TRUE => ZPb AND ZPa IS TRUE) & (objectA AND objectB IS TRUE => objectB and objectA IS TRUE)

## TODO unscoped rhetorical privilege

> talk about rhetoric as if it were a special case of `SDCFT` >> requires a ZPS/SDCFT analysis

- process of claiming rhetorical privilege
- process is poorly managed in many cases

"unjustified rhetorical privilege" / rewrite rhetorical intuitions / "Opportunity cost" in a Wartime Mindset / Wedding Cake argument / Steak argument / Rhetorical Privilege Critique

> One major aspect of the reader is in Wartime where their code resources are limited ... you wouldn't let an arbitrary book invade your precious time unboundedly (e.g., reading front to back at 100wpm when you could skim at 1000wpm). Also, high barrier of entry (e.g., the book rhetoric is so fluffy, it wastes hours of talent to produce this stuff)

> a three-tier "Wedding Cake" (DP rhetoric - privileged/memory rhetoric - detail rhetoric) model to comprehensively rewrite the reader's intuition about rhetorical styles and rhetorical effectiveness.

> entrepreneur <> tech (~= the "alien ship" metaphor)

> well metaphors ~= MCMM fits very well into the well metaphor [talk about/ brainstorming]

## TODO scoped rhetorical privilege

> Problem-Solution Rhetoric becomes a special case of scoped rhetorical privilege.

> Register/ Use documents! Use the register (crystallization, conversation, verbal tricks, background knowledge, reading genre, etc.)!

> Use of first principles rhetoric, most notably, cliches and narratives and systems analogies

> rhetorical momentum as the system of rhetorical privilege

> Discuss the `@` notation for rhetorical privilege. We look at Trees, Maps, and Theorems as a way of writing that is more explicit about `@`.

TODO what words signify rhetorical privilege + scoped rhetorical privilege?

~= and <> are both rhetorical symbols. Does that suggest that they are the same thing? TODO. Probably not, because ~= demands ZPS rigor while <> is scoped rhetorical privilege.

> scope = inter-text First-Class-Function Stream-Of-Consciousness? (so scope requires introducing this formalism)

## TODO discuss notation

TODO Simplify the training to clarify that the main functional unit is temporal ping-pong painting. This creates the necessary creativity but "channeling" creativity into intelligence is a hugely difficult task. This is why we need the rigor of all this "stuff."

- A rhetorical push ">>" would be a portal "&" where the portal construct is rhetorically privileged
- A curly bracket notation "{}" would be a portal "&" between the normal outside and privileged inside
- An asterisk "*" or footnote -- unchanged definition, but can act as a _de facto_ side channel
- *{Footnote} notation becomes a real possibility

TODO create an outline at the top with all the good notation?

## TODO constructs and deconstruction

construct <> system <> First Principle <> deconstruction

## TODO community analysis

> We discuss the nature of creativity, entrepreneurship, UX design, and leadership.

> We hypothesize powerful causal links between inefficient rhetoric and inefficient self-help.

> Self-help community; leadership community; rationality community; etc. >> filling out charts of "what I think could be improved, using this framework." Epistemology Tables to productively cover ground

## TODO the four rules

1. Snaps
2. Density
3. Contentment
4. Curiosity
