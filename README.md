# New ways to train cognitive map aptitudes, increase cognitive intelligence, and cope with psychopathologies

## Revised Introduction

This essay establishes a terminology of **cognitive maps**.

- One source claims that "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds."
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560
- Relational Frame Theory is framed in terms of the cognitive map.
  - At a young age, the cognitive map self-organizes through nonverbal acquisition of first principles and mental models.
    - Is the approach of Multiple Exemplar Training in Relational Frame Theory the most efficient? In this light, what do we say about the **prior art** of Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in SMART training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ"? [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training; https://raiseyouriq.com]

We outline a major difference between two neural circuits: Reward and Punishment versus Rational Behavior.

Using an analogy to two major classes of computer processors, we call the former the CPU and the latter the GPU.

- First circuit: CPU
  - Reward and punishment / operant behavior
    - primary actor in the CPU
    - emotional impulsivity?
  - Is it reasonable to make a training philosophy designed to force the CPU to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility?
  - The GPU would create a CORRECT-INCORRECT binary signal of rationality that could overwrite the CPU.
    - This is treated as a **local maxima** of rationality.
- Second circuit: GPU
  - Rational behavior / cognitive map
    - primary actor in the GPU
    - accounts for operant behavior
  - token painting aptitude
    - Can a **training curriculum** be developed to increase **token painting aptitude** -- one's productivity in responding to cues by activating (paying attention to) the right subset of the cognitive map -- and would this increase cognitive intelligence?
  - self-regulation
    - Do cognitive maps reflect something fundamental in **psychopathology**? At the very least, virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to put work into better organizing one's cognitive map.

    - comparison to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy

### Main takeaway

I think that SMART training supports the hypothesis that **GPU stress leads to positive results in cognitive intelligence aptitude increase**.

However, is SMART training _efficient_ at GPU stress? SMART training takes thousands of repetitions.

We claim that not only does our training have fewer repetitions, it has an advantageous _training timeline_. In ```How to avoid training plateaus?``` we discuss how our training unlocks an _efficient_ process at graduating from **dense** to **sparse** cognitive skills, creating a level of _cognitive control and intuition_ that neither SMART training nor the best prior art in pedagogy does.

## Revised Training

### Terminology

- Different appearances encode different levels of **detail** when visualized.
  - ```cartoony appearance < realistic appearance```
- A cue is **dense** (opposite of **sparse**) when it is trivial to find details within it -- a **"snowballing"** of cumulatively finding details within a cue, from very little detail to lots of detail.
  - In terms of deliberate practice, dense cues would be within the "comfort zone."
  - The deliberate practice cycle combines dense and sparse cues.
  - This frequently occurs in the spatial-visual training context, considering the fast speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained).
  - Episodic memory is pretty dense.
  - Declarative memory is notoriously sparse.
- The **Ebbinghaus asymptote** is a common-sense assumption from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.
  - The present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an **asymptotic** (virtually infinite detail level) episodic memory.
  - To be clear, seeing an image and forgetting 90% of episodic detail between second 1 and second 10 (after assuming similar rates and extrapolating) reasonably implies that second 0.01 must be incredibly dense (thousands to millions of details) and that the density of second 0 must be virtually infinite.
- There is a terminology parallel with Relational Frame Theory.
  - TODO? SAME-DIFF => "portaling"; MORE-LESS => "snowballing"; HIERARCHY => "painting"

### Formulating the training exercise

**Pick two cues to switch attention between (e.g., two objects in your physical surroundings).**

The **portal** procedure will be defined as operating over any two cues (notation: ```&```).

- Cue A.
- Cue B.
- Also consider cue AB.
  - (a visual "merging together" or "melting together" of A/B)
- Also consider cue X.
  - (anything in the room that isn't A or B)

**Eventually, you should practice the following portals.**

- ```A&B```
- ```X&AB```
- ```AB&A```
- ```AB&B```

**You might see how this training is meant as the first step in an extensive curriculum of moving to sparser and sparser cues?**

This point is addressed further in ```How to avoid training plateaus? Considerations of deliberate practice.```.

### Procedure of training exercise (how to exercise the CORRECT-INCORRECT binary of attention)

The portal procedure is defined as a cycle (repeated several times) in a steady **"temporal ping-pong"** rhythm. There is **dual pressure** -- two **detail hierarchies** being proliferated at once.

- Label the cue you want to pay attention to as CORRECT. Label the other cue as INCORRECT.
  - Notice how the INCORRECT cue is unambiguously **anti-attention**.
- **Snowball** from the CORRECT cue.
  - (detail possibilities: locations of particular lines, shades of color, any associated memory, style of the room, time of day, etc.)
- Switch the CORRECT and INCORRECT cue around.
  - At this time, it is useful to practice the **CORRECT-INCORRECT binary swap**. If my goal were to label everything incorrectly, and A were correct, labeling A as "correct" is incorrect while labeling A as "incorrect" is correct.
  - At this time, you should also practice judging CORRECT versus INCORRECT based on how **surprising** the difference between the actual case and the anticipated case is.

### Advantage 1: Attention-related interferences are stressed

- paying attention to a cue vs. paying attention to the details hierarchically encoded within the cue
- correct vs. incorrect (in particular, better managing any symbolic reasoning involved).
- not directly specifying which object is Correct versus Incorrect until the last milliseconds and seeing how fast your brain can pay attention / react
- Cue#1 vs. Cue#2

### Advantage 2: Cognitive maps are stressed

- A, B, and X are all episodic memories and also members of the **cognitive map**.
- Crowd A of neurons continues to talk to Crowd B and Crowd X resulting in very strong combinatorial interactions.
  - Details are pulled in pairs (jump to Cue#1, pull a detail, jump to Cue#2, pull another detail).
  - Does this make the training more robust? I don't know.

### Advantage 3: The exercise is far more than a "detail mindfulness habit"

Does our exercise go beyond merely creating a marginal chance of a "random quiz" to get the brain to pay attention? Yes; The exercise as a whole is a massive **signal booster** of attention/reward/punishment.

- The narrow focus (only two cues and the details within them) make the INCORRECT case very specific. This trains a migration of attention between two points (which make a straight line!)
  - This suggests the importance of also practicing memory palace (method of loci) navigation and visualizing "drawing a curved line across the path."
- There is a strong visualization aspect; I believe the "mind's eye" works by storing the delta between the present and the desired visualization.
  - An alternate explanation is that the "mind's eye" works by fluctuating from past (synthesizing the necessary episodic memories) to present.
  - To be clear, I think the GPU is capable of the sensory process of visualization -- simulating the future from the episodic past/present.
- There is an incredibly fast density shift from Cue A to Cue B and back. I strongly suspect the mechanistic manipulation of a "a back-and-forth brain wave rhythm" like "sitting on a rocking chair."
  - Clearly feel that each cue attention shift drops details from the brain. For amplifying this effect, apply **line-diagram notation**.
    - Visually annotate the room with boundaries and curves with lines (like an artist would!).
    - The goal is to preserve as much detail as possible when cues are "copied" into some working memory buffer (e.g., I force myself to color the objects RED and GREEN).

### How to avoid training plateaus? Considerations of deliberate practice.

> TODO! Anything in italics is a sophisticated metaphor/construct that requires further explanation.

1. Use _dense constructs_ so that the situation as a whole is a dense cue.
2. Trivially move to a _dual pressure situation_ by finding two details that are both equivalent to sparse cues.
3. Portal between them with the help of the _rhythm system_ or _multiple-document cycle_.

**Some more details.**

- _dense constructs_ include:
  - _first principles_
  - _systems analysis_
  - _legalistic constructs_
  - _semi-mnemonics_
- _Thin Client Principle_: the details of dense cues might be a sparse cue
- a _content buffer_ over an extended period of time
- critique of _Krashen Input Hypothesis_

### How to avoid training plateaus? TODO: unorganized tips

> TODO! No guarantee of clear explanation.

I noticed improvement in creativity without implementing even half of these, so a vague understanding of these tips should suffice for the beginner.

- Build the **cue/stimulus equivalence understanding** of how CUE equals REWARD AND PUNISH equals PHYSICAL OBJECT equals WRAPPER (for hundreds of details).
  - Creating metaphors for reward, punishment, and the cue-detail relationship, clearly understood to be a hierarchy.
    - one cue, many details
    - details can be associated with other details
    - details have subdetails
    - details can turn into new cues
    - details can be shared between multiple cues
    - etc.
- Accept that you will have to relearn the **educational constructs** that you learned through rote.
  - You should start thinking in terms of "KWL charts," "hamburger models of essays," and so on.
  - Create metaphors for logical relations and inductions.
    - "NOT" signs
    - "LESS THAN" and "MORE THAN" signs
    - Imagine a bubble that says "NOT (A =/= B)" sprouting from the bubble of "A == B".
  - Create a productive standardized format of data exchange.
    - This is discussed at length in the more advanced or TODO sections?
- Practicing visualizing the variables of a logical formula as a series of **zero cues** which are small gray-colored spheres that can be colored depending on the formula position. Such cues would be at the top of the **cue hierarchy** -- the Platonic Ideal that all **one cues** (specific cues) descend from.
  - The relevant portal formula is: ```0&1```
  - The point is to build confidence in the skill generalization: is mastering the logic of variables equal to mastering logical comparisons between specific objects? is creativity the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres? is there a general aptitude of jumping from one sphere to another sphere independent from the first one?
  - **TODO: This is when we come full circle to the prior art -- the ideas of SMART training -- useful although incomplete.**

### TODO: a list of more formulas for snowballing

> TODO? Practice random-access jumping between a cumulating list of items in a memory palace journey. But also a _Random-Access Stress_ in general. This is the best dense construct available ... TODO?

```
A&AB

0 & 01
1 & 2 => 01 & 012
2 & 3 => 012 & 0123
3 & 4 => 0123 & 01234

involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item" that all other objects originate from

Zero & Zero Question
Zero Question & Zero Question Answer

less detailed item & more detailed item
```

```
Logic A > B means that B < A [see: Relational Frame Theory]
You could visualize this as a two-variable equation
Even jumping from "front of flashcard" to "back of flashcard" is a logic formula of Item1 + Item2
```

## TODO: The hand-motion game ("Snaps") of self-regulation

How can a _hand-motion game_ -- say, waving your hand one way for "yes" and the other way for "no" -- exercise rational behavior and self-regulation? In the case of having the hand stuck in the middle, as you are stuck in what appears to be an infinitely unchanging apathetic state, emphasize how you **don't know when** you'll finally break out.

- No reliable signal exists to differentiate the state of apathy and the state of being _about to act_ within a reasonable amount of reaction time.
- What develops is a **childlike curiosity of playing games** that acts as a psychological sensitivity towards rational behavior -- a feeling that self-regulation is as easy as "downhill sledding."
- We need to investigate self-regulation denseness vs. sparseness. Hand-motion games are dense cases that you need to then use deliberate practice and imagination to expand out to sparse cases. (It is trivial to control the details of your hand-motion action but less so for the sparser things.)
- The hand-motion game applies the rationality network, which is extremely resilient to stress, as a universal psychological buffer. Even when you feel out of shape, the psychological fundamentals of rationality (the first principles of other first principles) creates a sense of common human identity.
