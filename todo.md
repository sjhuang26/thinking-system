# TODO

## Research plan

What do other people say about behaviorism?

Put the most dense material first, because the less dense material is counterintuitively far harder to work with (not always? look for exceptions).

1. RFT: A Post-Skinnerian Account; any remotely significant chapters read and take notes
2. The research articles' specific formulation of SMART training
3. What is Multiple Exemplar Training?
4. What is rote learning vs. active learning?
5. What are the taxonomies, Bloom's taxonomy, what is state-of-the-art in active thinking?
6. The research article that tries to defend behaviorism
7. Any material off of the ACBS website
8. Presentations at workshops
9. Weaknesses of behaviorism that other people have written about?
10. Articles about ADHD; https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html
11. Articles about ADHD compared to creativity
12. Material about Valued Action in ACT therapy
13. Material about deliteralization in ACT therapy

We would probably have several documents.

1. One "practitioner's takeaways" document that contains the kinds of resources that I would use in my day-to-day training (my perspective).
2. One document to add rhetorical "momentum."
3. One document to hit the highlights of the "practitioner's takaways."
4. One document purely as a list of terminologies so that we can categorize them efficiently and track the existing literature.

## Criticism of social studies textbook I use.

Personally important so I can learn how to cognitively manage it.

An antagonism exists between the textbook's "consistent narrative voice" and the study-notes website (which shows you what students are desperately thirsting for) that merits serious attention.

Study-note websites provide easy memorization outlines, straightforward topic overviews, and challenging test-prep reading comprehension questions. We need to show students how profound and complex history is, and that is what extended excerpts of primary documents are for. Primary documents are cognitively expensive; these narratives carry their insights in the most cognitively expensive and unproductive ways. We need to act against this hyperinflation trend -- this high school pedagogical fashion -- where somehow this fluffiness is OK, where thirty textbook pages are worth hardly three diligent notebook pages.

One sentence from the study-notes website is essentially equal to one or more textbook paragraphs. The textbook creates a slippery sensation of marginally skimmable facts and figures; to gather tiny fragments of the main point, it takes at least two or three jarring back-glances and searches; the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve suggests that >90% of fragments are forgotten in the next 20 minutes and left essentially unreviewed. No college would dream of training their students this way!

What you need to see, though, is that the textbook does teach attention regulation and narrative building in your head. That counts for something if you really learn to see through the cruft and see the First Principles (especially of human interaction) being rolled out, over and over again, the authors rolling out the same red carpet for the same honored guest, Human Interaction First Principles in History. But this is not the DP unless you actively get better at schema building.

## Genre strategy

- "in media res"? Sales copy should reflect an "in media res" where the reader is in a crucial point in the middle of a long-winded journey

## Rhetorical strategy

Writing is about creating hotspots of attention.

- narrow spotlight
- psychologically motivating the reader to think about something

Claim + illustrations of the first principles of what is claimed

I decided that "draining the swamp of rhetoric" is easiest with the thin client* formula: ```claim + illustrations of the first principles of what is claimed```**.

*computer science analogy

**There are strong parallels to patents (standardized patent format).

A mapper will "sit and think" about "collect[ed] information" to "simplify" the "mental map" while a packer lacks command of the aforementioned simplifying process. [https://wiki.c2.com/?MappersVsPackers]
