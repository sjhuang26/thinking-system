# MPSOC risk prevention

As a practical matter, I will publish the following on how you can avoid the massive ADHD-like / psychological grief / identity disorder risk factor of the Thinking System.

Realize that there is a sharp divide between the identity of the Prior You and the New You. This can be extremely traumatic. You've lost that "rote CPU knowledge" of the prior self so you need to actively recall the episodic memories of your prior self to rebuild it. It will take weeks to rebuild the new identity but you can optimize the key portions. All re-learning is very quick if you do it properly and have no severe underlying psychological issues. If you don't know what you're doing, it will take far longer.

> You will suddenly lose your identity as an academic, as a socializer, as a person in general, becoming the identity equivalent of some "blank slate" individual.

> Understand that you will suddenly lose many habits once you start "inhabiting" models like Serial Data Code Full Text.

1. exclusionary attention >> You should practice switching between "boring sensory data" such as words on a computer screen.
2. snowballing >> You need to create a coding system based on SDCFT. {Create Codes as hyperlinks that command you to do various things. This is how you "build bridges."} {technical detail/ Code Zero = a "hyperlink" that tells you, "just do Correct, obviously, base your action on context!" Code One = a snowballing of Code Zero that can be any synthesis of context as a message for NOW. Code Two = the response to Code One (the document abstraction of a postscript; "P.S. in addition, XYZ") and so on.}
3. painting >> You need to understand that the essence of Serial Data + Full Text is to paint regions on the "notebook paper."
4. document structure >> Learn a formal document structure. (e.g., Crystallized-Fluid binary; imagine that the first sentences of the document are crystallized while the rest of the document is far more fluid.) The way document reading is taught in schools is quite rote and the Thinking System will force you to re-learn it.
5. contentment >> Learn some rhetorical catchphrase of being content. This is easily missed.
6. polyfill of CPU >> Polyfill the CPU by creating Emotional Tokens of reward/punishment (e.g., smiley faces and sad faces) because the reward/punishment emotional network is going to be seriously damped out and then intentionally see the smiley faces and sad faces as a relic of some dissociated past episodic memory that works as a "cheat sheet" for the present self
