## TODO Concepts of rhetoric

### Constructs and deconstruction

TODO. Try to clarify this as quick as possible because this shouldn't be an advanced concept -- we just have to mention First Principle exaptation and the rest is a matter for the student to deal with.

- construct <> system <> First Principle <> deconstruction

A system is defined in the dictionaries as:

> [Merriam Webster] the act, process, or profession of studying an activity (such as a procedure, a business, or a physiological function) typically by mathematical means in order to define its goals or purposes and to discover operations and procedures for accomplishing them most efficiently
>
> [Google Dictionary] a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a set of principles or procedures according to which something is done; an organized scheme or method.

Speculative applications

> We discuss the nature of creativity, entrepreneurship, UX design, and leadership.

> We hypothesize powerful causal links between inefficient rhetoric and inefficient self-help.

> Self-help community; leadership community; rationality community; etc. >> filling out charts of "what I think could be improved, using this framework." Epistemology Tables to productively cover ground

> based on first principles such as those pertaining to self-identity, personal values, ethics, morality, and life experiences, as well as a general set of first principles generally and arbitrarily applicable to constitute an exciting new hypothetical training system of "polymath creativity."

> First principles are descriptions of the partly innate and partly acquired aspects of the rationality map that rhetoric can convey.

### Motivation

TODO/ Rhetorical privilege is necessary only at a later stage in the training. Make this part of the training timeline.

CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM!!! "unjustified rhetorical privilege" >> NECESSITY of rewrite rhetorical intuitions; rhetorical styles; sense of rhetorical productivity

"Wartime makes it clear who's Mapper and who's Packer." "aggressive" 90% reduction in volume while retaining X% of the "meat"; The higher we can make that X% the higher value there is for society. That is my attitude.

### Outline

- _Wartime Mindset_ argument
- _Tech Entrepreneur_ argument
- _Alien Ship_ argument
- _Steak_ argument >> illustrate the wartime vs. peacetime dialectic
- _Wedding Cake_ argument
  - DP rhetoric
  - ZPS-memory privileged rhetoric ("privileged rhetoric")
  - detail rhetoric
- _Rhetorical Privilege_ argument
- limited resources; difficulty of writing (e.g., the book rhetoric is so fluffy, it wastes hours of talent to produce this stuff)

### Applications

rhetorical momentum as the Code of rhetorical privilege

- TODO: multi-document workflows; First Class Function Stream-Of-Consciousness

What words signify unbounded/bounded rhetorical privilege?

- brainstorming
  - well metaphors
  - MCMM (Mikado Method, Categorization, Mental Model)
- Problem-Solution rhetoric
- Classify-Divide rhetoric
- College admissions essays and tone (crystallization, conversation, verbal tricks, background knowledge, reading genre, etc.)
- Harris moves and intertext [Rewriting: How To Do Things With Texts]
- first principles rhetoric
  - cliches
  - narratives
  - systems analogies

Discuss the `@` notation for rhetorical privilege.

As an exemplar, discuss [Trees, Maps, and Theorems].

### Notation

- A rhetorical push `>>` would be a portal where the portal construct is rhetorically privileged
- A curly bracket notation `{}` would be a portal between the normal outside and privileged inside
- An asterisk `*` or footnote -- suggests a _de facto_ side channel (`*{Footnote}` notation becomes a real possibility)
- TODO: ```@X``` or ```X/ Y``` as rhetorical privilge? (e.g., `problem/ A; solution/ B`)
