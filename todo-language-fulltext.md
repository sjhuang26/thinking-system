# The Fulltext Wars

Linear fulltext (Word documents, writing, computer code, etc.)

- sales
- software engineering
- rhetoric
- audience-oriented deliberate practice
  - stick something out for pattern recognition (patent claim system)
  - pose a hard question that is beneficial to the audience to wrack their brain over

SDCFT formulation: Serial Data Code Full Text

Tentative canon for SDCFT:

- Secrets of Question Based Selling
- there is a way to judge down many leadership books -- failure of utility (Paul Graham and LISP)
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems >> async

Hackers and Painters by Paul Graham. The feeling that anything short of LISP data-as-code isn't fully malleable. It isn't really fulltext. Anything less is bad. The system starts to crumble.

Each book changes the flavor of the whole fulltext approach. Mastering fulltext is mastering character.

"Pedagogial hacking". A school should be a set of building blocks that can freely be interlinked, because when school becomes disassembleable, the rate of innovation is far higher.

The flow of pedagogy can be controlled with curriculum.

design patterns >> a concise way of speaking of issues, rhetoric, also one of the most powerful pedagogial tools there is for software engineering

A pedagogical bottleneck is when there is an educational tool that is so good and so crucial that it fundamentally alters the structure of knowledge in an apprentice.

We could write a book entitled "20 classic schemas for institutional change" and no one would really implement it. This roots from a poor education system.

Education is simply about having a continuity of language from "home language" to "college language."

Modern psychology (SMART training RFT) is the most ruthless pedagogial bottleneck. It radically alters the meaning of education.

If education really heeds its ideas, it will become 10x more efficient at least.

It seems like teamwork and institutional change could really be a bunch of hacks. One hack for brainstorming (Six Hats). One hack for sales. One hack for psych. etc. The big books like Peopleware are taking a bad approach. They are trying to engineer a system but they aren't LISPing it.

Tools of Titans The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers by Timothy Ferriss (z-lib.org) >> We can see, Tim Ferris really has no mature understanding of a self-improvement community system. Neither does Tony Robbins etc. There is no maturity of perspective. Psychological unity between theory/practice with universal LISP! Rhetorical mechanics! Systems optimization! Study of incomplete information! But all we get are a bunch of stupid truisms.

Rhetorical privilege: rhetoric is made to be memorized. So be careful what you push on the reader to memorize.

"Every day at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business. ... We didn’t do business at IBM, we built one"

The trouble with physics by Lee Smolin. Makes you think about how Pareto optimal it is. Nothing could be quite as good as this book at this particular time.

Franchise of self-help -- isn't this obvious? a ruthless pedagogial bottleneck. This is alluded to in lots of prior art rhetoric, but it isn't a position taken seriously -- meticulously -- like Ray Crok did it in McDonalds. He would make sure everything was spotless. This isn't what we see. Because they've modernized everything into "personal growth" and fogged up the sheer black-and-white rigor of state changes.

Business leadership tries to train this self-help in a rigorous way. But really? Is it really successful?

- They do not deconstruct the person from the very roots.

How can we tap into cultural undercurrents?

Quiet The Power of Introverts in a World That Cant Stop Talking by Susan Cain

The New One Minute Manager >> They are pushing the correct thing. They want one-minute self-help that is rigorous.

Personal freedom and agency (e.g., "I get to call the shots!") in the light of reward and punishment seems like a Self rebellion against the Other cognitive map. Where do cognitive map constructs come from? Environment? (some all-embodying construct (like "rationality") with subconstructs (like "morality" and "reasonableness" and "virtue")). One major aspect of religion besides epistemology is this idea of sacred culture, and within the cognitive map, with all this latent intellectual curiosity, it seems rational to set up a religious culture.

"QUOTE RFT argues that AARR is a generalized operant class ... nonarbitrary properties of the stimuli involved ... exposure to a sufficient number of exemplars of varying topography serves to abstract or "wash out" these irrelevant factors and brings the functional relation under the control of arbitrary contextual clues ... relational responding is said to be arbitrarily applicable."

So what if there were more productive processes? Imagine that the Generalized and Functionally Defined Operant is a superhighway across the cognitive map. (But nevertheless, even as you are "cheating" like this to accel response time, you have a general logical sense of NOT NOT A = A or "if two ways of using words lead to exactly the same consequences in the system, they are substitutable words") However, there is another aspect of how real intelligence comes from leveraging the all sorts of asymmetric cognitive map layouts that can exist while maintaining a symmetric (generalized and functionally defined) capability of putting those asymmetries in context. For example, when you pay attention to something, the attention soldiers are meaningful because they warp the fabric of the cognitive map.

In addition to whatever superhighway the researchers have figured out, we speculate that attention is a big deal.

Writing a textbook + reading textbook = compile vs. run (what is the LISP approach?)

I have frequently found practical use for the academic study pattern: brief exposure on day 1, break, deep dive on day 7.

## QUOTES from Smolin

Smolin uses his experience as a theoretical physicist to holistically critique academia and claim causes for the physics plateau. Smolin asserts that "the physics community is structured in such a way that large research programs that promote themselves aggressively have an advantage over smaller programs that make more cautious claims" and favors instead the rise of "small, risky new research programs." Smolin claims that the career ladder functions on the process to "impress older scientists with technically sweet solutions to long-standing problems posed by dominant research programs" in opposition to thinking "deeply and independently" to "try to formulate one’s own ideas."

> This reflects the process of resume-building. The real engineer is the one who slogs through some crazy internal situation and keeps a whole sector barely afloat. These are the kinds of good engineers. The ones who navigate through 300k lines of legacy code and make it work. Those don't translate into resume lines as well as the "technically sweet solutions"

Smolin equates science to democracy, pointing out that just like in democracy, scientists have equal rights but not mere majority rule. and also, there is a "constant struggle to overcome our built-in tendency to fool ourselves and fool others" through the practice of "correctives" that yield synergetic wisdom.

Smolin deconstructs the philosophy of science by saying that the definition of science cannot be properly made by general abstract processes that apply in "any possible world."

Smolin emphasizes the role of the shared ethic. "If an issue can be decided by people of good faith, applying rational argument to publicly available evidence, then it must be regarded as so decided. If, on the other hand, rational argument from the publicly available evidence does not succeed in bringing people of good faith to agreement on an issue, society must allow and even encourage people to draw diverse conclusions ... the future will bring surprises, in the form of new discoveries and new crises to be overcome. Rather than placing faith in their present knowledge, its members invest their hopes and expectations for the future in future generations, by passing along to them the ethical precepts and tools of thinking, individual and collective, that will enable them to overcome and take advantage of circumstances that are beyond the present powers of imagination." Smolin later says, "At its finest, the scientific community takes advantage of our best impulses and desires while protecting us from our worst. The community works in part by harnessing the arrogance and ambition we each in some degree bring to the search. Richard Feynman may have said it best: Science is the organized skepticism in the reliability of expert opinion."

Smolin notes the rare aptitude to "[ask] genuinely novel but relevant questions" or "look at the state of a technical field and see a hidden assumption or a new avenue of research" and establishes a dichotomy of seer vs craftsperson. Smolin speaks out against a linearism where "only one theory is contemplated at a time." Smolin claims that there exist "revolutionary periods" where "you need seers, who can peer ahead into the darkness." With such conflicting mindsets, "it is only to be expected that members of these two groups misunderstand and mistrust each other."

When Einstein says, "It’s not that I’m so smart. It’s just that I stay with problems longer" this really may reflect differential innate aptitude. ""History demonstrates that the kind of person who becomes a seer is sometimes mediocre when compared with the mathematically clever scientists who excel at problem solving." Smolin writes about a striking anecode: "Niels Bohr was an even more extreme case. Mara Beller, a historian who has studied his work in detail, points out that there was not a single calculation in his research notebooks, which were all verbal argument and pictures."

Smolin describes a personal confusion as an undergraduate about the periods: "If I looked at the kinds of questions that remained open, we were clearly partway through a revolution. But if I looked at how the people around me worked, we were just as obviously doing normal science ... We are indeed in a revolutionary period, but we are trying to get out of it using the inadequate tools and organization of normal science." Later, Smolin continues the personal story. "When I learned physics in the 1970s, it was almost as if we were being taught to look down on people who thought about foundational problems. When we asked about the foundational issues in quantum theory, we were told that no one fully understood them but that concern with them was no longer part of science. The job was to take quantum mechanics as given and apply it to new problems. The spirit was pragmatic; 'Shut up and calculate' was the mantra. People who couldn’t let go of their misgivings over the meaning of quantum theory were regarded as losers who couldn’t do the work."

Smolin gives a comprehensive narrative arc of the crisis in physis. After visionaries like "Einstein above all, but also Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and a few others" produced "partially successful theories—quantum mechanics and general relativity—for us to build on," it required "hard technical work" to continue upwards, leading to the dominance of craftspeople along with a "reversal in the style of theoretical physics, from the reflective foundational mode of Einstein and his peers to the pragmatic, aggressive mode that gave us the standard model." Smolin calls the standard model of particle physics a "triumph of this pragmatic style" but points out that such "normal science" reasonably has hit its limit. "Since then, we have been mired, because what we need is a return to a revolutionary kind of science. Once again, we need a few seers. The problem is that there are now very few around, as a result of science having been done so long in a way that rarely recognized and barely tolerated them."

Smolin gives historical perspective on academia. "Between the early twentieth century and the last quarter century, science—and the academy in general—has become much more organized and professionalized ... Even if everyone can see that a revolution is necessary, the most powerful parts of our community have forgotten how to make one."

Smolin says, "I have nothing against people who practice science as craft, whose work is based on the mastery of technique. This is what makes normal science so powerful. But it is a fantasy to imagine that foundational problems can be solved by technical problem solving within existing theories." So of course, towards modern innovations like string theory, Smolin asserts, "The paradoxical situation of string theory—so much promise, so little fulfillment—is exactly what you get when a lot of highly trained master craftspeople try to do the work of seers."

Smolin doesn't know of any paper by a string theorist that "attempts to relate the issues faced by string theory to the older writings by physicists and philosophers on the big issues in the foundations of space, time, or quantum theory."

Smolin describes visionaries who (despite publishing next to nothing) still "were accomplishing a great deal" by "concentrated study and thought" -- "thinking, and in a deeper, more focused way than an assistant professor can, about a single recalcitrant foundational issue." After "roughly a decade," the visionaries possessed a "considered, original, and mature viewpoint" that led to a quick rise in their peer community.

Smolin gives advice that seers have "essential" needs to "be alone for an extended period at the beginning of a career, and often in later periods."

Smolin quotes Alexander Grothendieck. "I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradle—while for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things that I had to learn (so I was assured), things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates, almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects. In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still, from the perspective of thirty or thirty-five years, I can state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve all done things, often beautiful things, in a context that was already set out before them, which they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they would have had to rediscover in themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was mine: the capacity to be alone."

Smolin compares business to academia with regard to risk analysis: "It is much easier to have a useful and honest conversation ... with a businessperson than with an academic." Hierarchy is similar to risk, and Smolin claims a recent trend of "[giving] young people more power and scope." This, of course, doesn't happen in academia. Smolin makes a similar comparison to music. "Innovation in music proceeds at such a hectic, vibrant pace because young musicians can find ways to connect to audiences and other musicians quickly, in clubs and on the radio, without having to ask the permission of established artists with their own agendas."

Smolin points out the severe bias and uses it to justify affirmative action. "In all my experience, I have never seen a woman or an African American hired through an affirmative-action program who didn’t strongly deserve it—that is, who wasn’t already arguably the best applicant. When hiring committees are no longer composed only of white men and we stop hearing expressions of open prejudice, then we can relax affirmative action."

To cap off the academia case, Smolin says, "Science requires a balance between rebellion and respect, so there will always be arguments between radicals and conservatives. But there is no balance in the current academic world. More than at any time in the history of science, the cards are stacked against the revolutionary. Such people are simply not tolerated in the research universities. Little wonder, then, that even when the science clearly calls for one, we can’t seem to pull off a revolution."

Smolin advises basic budgeting. "A research program should not be allowed to become institutionally dominant before it has gathered convincing scientific proof. Until it does, alternative approaches should be encouraged, so that the progress of science is not stalled by overinvestment in a wrong direction. When there is a recalcitrant but key problem, there should be a limit on the proportion of support given to any one research program that aims to solve it—say, a third of total funding."
