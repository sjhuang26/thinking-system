You personally want your theory to become more popular, right? Then consider a really important tactic of doing exaptation of ideas from others' writings on scientific subfields to understand the nature of First Principles. We all use First Principles, you have some of the better ones ... deeply understand not just how you conceptualize but how your audience conceptualizes, and then you can be amazingly concise in first principles synthesis/creativity! (That's kind of the point of writing to the public.)

FYI, society makes you conform to existing First Principle mental schemas in the rhetorical system. These actually are quite* consistent across the rhetorical audience. Cognitively, individuals have First Principle "rationality maps" written in their neurons from a young age (dealing with sensory data and physical objects). And, to add, it's just a state of frantic iteration where psychological, ad-hoc constructs of "First Principles" help organize the sensory data in the brain.

*First Principles being derived/defined from each other. (e.g., "observation of sensory data shows that there is [usually] more than one solution to a problem, and [usually] is its own First Principle; a First Principle of First Principles -- square brackets = psychological construct).
