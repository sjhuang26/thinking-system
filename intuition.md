I'm really having trouble expressing the main intuition. When you know there's something new, you really feel it, but then when you write it down, even though it only takes a few main metaphors, it's hard!

The SMART training (Relational Frame Theory) says that Multiple Exemplar Training is a scientifically proven way to increase IQ through mastering "arbitrary applicable derived relations." I agree with the goal of training general relational response; I argue that  Multiple Exemplar Training is misapplied rote learning. Radical behaviorism feels like a neat and tidy construct where stimulus classes, as nice "tokens" of thought, are "pushed around" by the brain and yield various behaviors, but someone critical of rote learning would say that efficiency comes from proficiency in metaphor. From this general notion, I recommend a new application of Relational Frame Theory that is based on a journey of conceptualistic development.

At a philosophical level, I establish a dichotomy where the CPU is about Reward and Punishment (operant reinforcement, rote learning) while the GPU is about Rationality (simulating the future from the episodic past and the episodic present, cognitive map, creative intuition, maps of language rhetoric, mental models).

Arbitrarily applicable derived relations are characterized as superficially in the CPU and essentially in the GPU. In the conventional narrative, the CPU develops into a "token language" (e.g., sounds representing tokens) that through Multiple Exemplar Training becomes these generalizable relational skills. My opinion, however, is that over the years of sensory cues and behaviors, the GPU follows a trajectory of self-organization across first principles that combinatorially generalize (such that first principles have other first principles themselves). Once the CPU-driven stage completes and the "token bubbles" are crystallized in the GPU, the individual lets go of the helping hand of the CPU.

We propose new ideals for self-regulation, such that the individual shifts from CPU dominance to GPU dominance. The GPU creates a local maxima of rationality each moment: consistently "Correct" behavior. From this binary (Correct-Incorrect), the goal is for behavior to flow unhindered, avoiding (1) poor self-control (2) existential crisis. The ACT therapy is on the right track in the therapeutic context but isn't quite there yet. I have developed a more abstract version of ACT therapy.

Here are the five steps of the training program so that the the CPU can relinquish its cognitive responsibilities.

1. Imagine both correct and incorrect.
2. Learn a ton of metaphors.
3. SAME-DIFF teaches exclusionary attention.
4. MORE-LESS teaches snowballing.
5. HIERARCHY teaches painting.

Steps 1/2.

> visualize imagining correctly and then visualize imagining incorrectly. Principle of surprise >> on how surprising the difference between present and memory is, you should judge the quality of mental recall (affects all RFT relations earlier described)

> Educational constructs were learned through rote, requiring you to re-learn a bunch of stuff. For instance, the use of memorizing a "NOT" sign for the NOT relation. A "LESS" sign for the LESS relation. etc. metaphor-ize the relations and other rote understandings; create a productive standardized format of data exchange (Serial Data Code Full Text); base everything off of that home base

> same-different (e.g., hot vs. cold), more-less (e.g., small snowball, big snowball), hierarchy (e.g., zoom in / zoom out)

> for example, in a logic puzzle, the bubble corresponding to "A == B" can be expanded to cause the proliferation of "NOT (A =/= B)" which may subsequently bubble into awareness. This parallels the conventional Relational Frame Theory explanation but does not essentialize the CPU in cognitive thriving.

Steps 3/4/5.

Exclusionary attention as:

1. an interaction between every combinatorial pair of details
2. an interaction between every combinatorial pair of tokens
3. paying attention to This Thing while being precommitted to One Other Thing
4. a temporal ping-pong between Two Things (two tokens, A and B, rapidly bouncing attention between the two)

Snowballing as:

1. a cumulating series of objects from 0 to 01 to 012, involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item" that all other objects originate from
2. going from Question to Question+Answer
3. a cumulating sequence of densities

Neuron networks are hierarchies that:

1. are encapsulated by a token
2. can be painted with a color (RED-GREEN)
3. encode variegated details in various densities of detail

Token-details hierarchy as:

1. one token encapsulating many details
2. details as being shared by at least one possible token

Density is acted upon by the Ebbinghaus principles of forgetting.

1. The present sensory stream-of-consciousness is an asymptote of virtually infinite density.
2. Conventional episodic memory is worse.
3. Declarative memory is especially low.

Training context comprises:
1. temporal ping-pong
2. painting two neuron networks (A and B)
3. string together detail within A to detail within B
4. practice using a low-density visualization (easier to switch attention) to offload the difficulty of switching attention from one heavy tree of sensory data to another in a high-density, high-pressure situation (e.g., low-density Control Panel, high-density Present Sensory Data, attention switch capability)

> The input of the present sensory data is equivalent to encoding an extremely strong episodic memory that immediately begins to fade.

> In some training contexts (e.g., spatial-visual), it is trivial to absorb massive densities, such that the speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained) is astoundingly fast compared to the declarative memory schemas.

> CPU executive control and CPU attention >> GPU attention. The GPU attention is done by threatening yourself to pay attention properly using a "10% chance" of a random quiz.

> This might be the origin of visualization or the "mind's eye": ping pong between Present and Synthesis of Prior Episodic Memories (including the episodic memory of the present).

> At any point in time, there may exist many representations of the same physical object with wildly varying densities.

> Present = high. Far past = low. Question AND answer = high. Question = low. Realism = high. Cartoony appearance that is more encodable or memorable = low. Words = really low. Also practice cumulating keeping track of items in a memory palace journey, although the density fluctuation is lower (but it is still worth practicing this). Do the Correct-Incorrect exercises over the densities to suppress the CPU's operants. Hazy visualization, clear visualization, actually visually seeing the object in the present moment. etc.

> The GPU can do deep-mapping as a density-preserving operation. A strong image (e.g., the Present vision) can be deep-mapped into a strong image of a visualizations (e.g., coloring objects Red/Green/Gray) which can be also encoded in episodic memory. Deep mapping is an important marker of the upper end of the density scale.
