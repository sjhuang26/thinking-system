# Book Discussion: On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins, Sandra Blakeslee

So here is my model.

Hippocampus >> cognitive map. The purpose of the cognitive map is merely to sustain the loci of attention, as the very top executive function in the cortex cell hierarchy. The brain gets more productive at tracing attention paths into cortex cells that actually do the thinking.

Cortex cells arranged in a hierarchy >> attention soldiers -- units of hierarchical processing (analogy: Universal Turing Machine, pattern inference); whether high or low on the hierarchy, it's run by attention soldiers.

Thalamus >> interrupt circuit for attention that any cortex cell has access to.

Fundamentally, the brain is about prediction from past memory.
