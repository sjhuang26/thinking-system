## Revised Introduction

Here is the big picture of this essay.

1. Cognitive maps can be represented with simple paradigms like "navigation, painting, and spotlighting" that seem learnable: at least, virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to put work into better organizing one's cognitive map. From here, is it possible to write a cognitive map training curriculum which we can reasonably market as having powerful and useful effects on both psychological state and cognitive aptitude, and even as a general model of psychopathology versus psychological thriving?
2. Is the prior art of Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in https://raiseyouriq.com fundamentally unworkable?
3. From the cognitive map idea, we can start to talk about "one spatial reference point" versus "many spatial reference points." Can we use this general dichotomy to create a feasible education curriculum? How would such education change rhetoric?

## Revised Training

### Connections to Relational Theory

Relational Frame Theory emphasizes three fundamental relational frames.

Why are they noteworthy? They are inspirations for the training to follow.

1. SAME-DIFF teaches temporal ping-pong and Correct-Incorrect.
2. MORE-LESS teaches snowballing/curiosity.
3. HIERARCHY teaches cue/painting.

### Terminology

Detail >> Different appearances encode different levels of detail. (e.g., Cartoony appearance vs. realistic appearance)

- *{Details may be shared between multiple tokens.}

Density >> An item is dense if it is an exemplar case of encoding many details very easily under a single token. For instance, in some training contexts (e.g., spatial-visual), it is trivial to absorb massive detail, such that the speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained) is astoundingly fast compared to the declarative memory schemas, which are notoriously poor in density.

Sparsity >> the opposite of density.

"Ebbinghaus asymptote" >> assume that the present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an asymptotic (virtually infinite detail level) episodic memory. [Ebbinghaus principles of forgetting]

> Seeing an image and forgetting 90% of episodic detail between second 1 and second 10 implies (assume similar rates and extrapolate!) that second 0.01 must be an incredibly dense storage of thousands to millions of details and that second 0 must have virtually infinite detail density.

Snowballing >> Snowballing is cumulatively moving from less detail to more detail, like a curious person would.

### What is the training?

The training is a simple attention switch between arbitrary cues and details. The formula is:

```
(cue A, detail A) => (cue B, detail B) => (cue A, detail C) => (cue B, detail D) => A => B => A ...

We would say that there is a "PORTAL" between A and B, written as A&B. The portal symbolizes the skill that is generalized.

Apply a "temporal ping-pong."

Set up a rhythm.

When paying attention, label the target cue or detail as CORRECT while all other stuff (in particular, the OTHER item) is INCORRECT.
```

**The reader can conceptualize: why could this intervention possibly work? The training seems elementary, but I believe that schoolteachers and the whole education system totally fail to teach this stuff in a rigorous way.**

**To be clear, we develop the general skill of labeling items in the cognitive map.**

1. Episodic memory of Cue A, Episodic memory of Cue B, and Contextual Cue X (episodic memory of non-AB details such as the room, time of day, etc.) are members of the cognitive map.
2. Crowd A of neurons continues to talk to Crowd B and Crowd X resulting in very strong combinatorial interactions.

**Is this more than a reward-and-punishment game?** Where it only takes a "1% chance" of a random quiz to get the brain to pay attention? Our exercise is far more than that. Yes, it is a blunt way to build a "detail mindfulness habit," but at the same time, the OTHER PARTS of the exercise as a whole are a massive _signal booster_ of attention/reward/punishment until focus goes up.

**Is there a visualization aspect?** I believe the "mind's eye" works by storing the delta between the present and the desired visualization. I believe the "mind's eye" works by fluctuating from past (synthesizing the necessary episodic memories) to present.

**Is there a reduction in interference effects related to attention?** I think so. A big part is the interference between paying attention to a cue vs. paying attention to the details hierarchically encoded within the cue. Another big part is interference between Correct vs. incorrect (in particular, better managing any symbolic reasoning involved). Another big part is not directly specifying which object is correct versus incorrect until the last milliseconds and seeing how fast your brain can react.

**Why does the narrow focus of the exercise (only two cues and details within them) matter?**

1. Intuitively, I feel this is a MAJOR ADVANTAGE: focusing on two items has the major advantage that the Incorrect case unambiguously points to a single item.
2. Two points makes a straight line and navigation is definetly based on straight lines. However, this suggests the importance of also practicing memory palace (method of loci) navigation and visualizing "drawing a curved line across the path."

**Do you need to have a clear conceptualization that detail is lost when you shift attention to the other item?** At an incredibly fast pace, density shifts from Cue A to Cue B and back. So yes.

**I strongly suspect the mechanistic manipulation of a "a back-and-forth brain wave rhythm" like "sitting on a rocking chair."** The line-diagram notation (annotating boundaries and curves with lines -- like an artist!) tries to amplify this effect. We are trying to preserve as much detail as possible when the objects are "copied" into some working memory buffer (e.g., I force myself to color the objects RED and GREEN).

Hierarchy factors >> Hopefully I made it clear? One cue, many details.

### Unorganized tips

Getting the general gist of the exercises is enough for beginners. (I noticed improvement in creativity without implementing even half of these.)

The point is to have a clear plan to graduate from more dense to less dense items by using snowball formulas and other advanced techniques. Otherwise, you are virtually guaranteed to hit one of the many training plateaus, and you probably won't notice.

- Practicing the line of reasoning: if my goal were to label everything incorrectly, and A were correct, labeling A as "correct" is incorrect while labeling A as "incorrect" is correct.
- Ensuring the proper understanding of: CUE equals REWARD AND PUNISH equals PHYSICAL OBJECT equals WRAPPER (for hundreds of details).
  - Creating metaphors for reward, punishment, and the cue-detail relationship, clearly understood to be a hierarchy.
    - details can be associated with other details
    - details have subdetails
    - details can turn into new cues
    - details can be shared between multiple cues
    - etc.
- Start judging correctness on how cognitively surprising the difference between the actual case and the anticipated case is.
- Avoid "Packer self-blame" and other conscious/subconscious issues, especially during the metaphor-ization of logical associations.
  - a "NOT" sign for the NOT relation
  - a "LESS" sign for the LESS relation
  - imagining the bubble that says "NOT (A =/= B)" sprouting from the bubble of "A == B"
- Accept that you will have to "relearn" the educational constructs that you learned through rote.
  - Timewise, this will be a very fast relearning.
- Create a productive standardized format of data exchange.
  - This is discussed at length in the more advanced or TODO sections?
- Combinations of experiential exercises such as rationality reflection, ACT therapy deliteralization, and Snaps make practicing this shift feel like "downhill sledding" -- and it should?
- The rationality network is extremely resilient to stress; therefore, it buffers the psychological risks of the training.
  - social norms result in particular cases of wildly varying first principles, but the first principles of the first principles are far more similar; this is the sense of common human identity
- Follow some clear portal formulas. You should note that this point is further addressed in "snowballs."
  - 1A&1A2B => 1B&1B2A
  - less detailed item & more detailed item
  - etc.
- Use imagination to visualize a "variable object" as a sort of Platonic Ideal that all specific objects descend from
  - portal between specific item (one item) and a small gray-colored sphere that can be colored depending on the position in the formula (zero item)
    - placing a Platonic ideal (zero item) of universalist generalizability at the top of the object hierarchy
    - a confidence in the skill generalization where mastering the logic of variables is equal to mastering logical comparisons between specific objects
    - a confidence in creativity by the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres
    - a confidence in the ability to jump from one sphere to another sphere independent from the first one
