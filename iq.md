You personally want your theory to become more popular?

Please consider a really important tactic of doing exaptation of ideas from others' writings on scientific subfields to understand the nature of First Principles. We all use First Principles -- and you have some of the better ones -- but what I am saying is, deeply understand not just your set of first principles but also your audience's first principles. Then you can be amazingly creatively concise! (That's kind of the point of writing to the public!)

FYI: society makes you conform to existing First Principle mental schemas in the rhetorical system. These actually are quite* consistent across the rhetorical audience. Humans have cognitive maps written in their neurons from a young age (dealing with sensory data and physical objects); a state of frantic iteration involving ad-hoc constructs of "First Principles" and "rationality" is what helps organize the sensory data in the brain.

To wit, the cognitive map is just a rationality map.

*First Principles being derived/defined from each other. (e.g., "observation of sensory data shows that there is [usually] more than one solution to a problem, and [usually] is its own First Principle; a First Principle of First Principles -- square brackets = psychological construct).
