# "Snaps" self-regulation

We set up the hand-waving metaphor* as a template that fully contains the essence of Motivation.

The hand waves one way for "yes" and one way for "no," the middle way being an indeterminate state. At some point, the motions are so meaningless that you are going to play along, like a child playing a game, but you never know exactly when you will start playing*.

See how we are aligning the residuals of self-regulation training, a lot of which was done in childhood, from basic games, to operant training, to personal values? This game-like vesting of self-control is the powerful novelty.

*metaphor {
Hands >> almost a persona of physical action rooted in self-control
Operant training >> the innate capacity of humans to take decisive action to avoid punishment and seek reward
}

*playing {
The exercise begins with the hand in the indeterminate state, where it is impossible to determine whether one is truly apathetic or in a neurological state of motivation, within a reasonable amount of reaction time, where they are ABOUT to act.

> Practicing self-regulation typically reduces the emotional cost of the underlying behavior, but not always.
