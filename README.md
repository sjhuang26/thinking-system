# Defending the "Mapper-Packer" Dialectic as a Breakthrough Perspective in Applied Psychology

## Revised Introduction: Big Picture Questions

What is the "thought process and life methodology" of a profoundly gifted person like? Do they feel the same sensations as a normal person as they go through the stresses and traumas of life? If a normal person studies the process in the right way, do they turn into a profoundly gifted person? Can we claim that certain cognitive exercises will greatly accelerate this process? In life, which constructs are vital and which constructs are wasteful, in that virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to _make one's cognitive map more rational_*? *{"self-organization"}

## Introduction

Abstractions must be condensed for comprehensibility*, but the document is written with a clear dialectic in mind: a mapper will "sit and think" about "collect[ed] information" to "simplify" the "mental map" while a packer lacks command of the aforementioned simplifying process. [https://wiki.c2.com/?MappersVsPackers] The first step is to outline the neurological circuits that we speculate exist. We use an uninventive computer science metaphor to get the point across. GPU vs. CPU circuit.

CPU = Packer = Reward and Punishment circuit

GPU = Mapper = Rationality circuit

*{or else the document will be a "flight of ideas" in the derisive sense}

Our ultimate goal is to force the CPU to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility (using, for instance, metaphors), so that:

- wide-ranging psychological effects arise
  - We describe a therapy with the advantages of learnability (easy to learn), simplicity (very few elements), productivity (generally faster results).
  - We demonstrate that a Self-Other Relationship is psychologically necessary {pertains to: existential crisis vs. existential fulfillment; morality; religion}.
  - We examine my documentation of the extreme psychological effects that the therapy has produced in me.
- new opportunities for increasing cognitive intelligence appear
  - We develop a new training to cognitively stress the GPU far more.
  - We argue that the prior art [Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in https://raiseyouriq.com] is fundamentally unworkable.
- Limitation: the CPU stage may be necessary at a very young age to crystallize some "cue/token bubbles" in the GPU.
  - TODO: YOU MUST CLARIFY: Packers + tokens; Mappers + GPU contains a subsystem of Packers (rhetoric/ reconciliation process???)
  - TODO: YOU MUST CLARIFY: token = locus of attention/behavior (The neuron network encodes the details as being encapsulated by the token. The student associates the token with either RED or GREEN.)

### Prior art

SMART [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training] training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ"). TODO: argue that compared to our training, their training is fundamentally unworkable in cognitively stressing the GPU. However, the SMART training (inefficiently) works because repeating the drills hundreds to thousands of times creates a marginal stress on the GPU.

## Speculative neurological circuits

### The biggest speculation

> TODO merge all prior art into one assertion. STOP ESSENTIALIZING!!!

GPU/Cognitive map navigation is elevated above CPU/radical behavioralism.

Cognitive map regions are "painted" with linguistic tokens. This token painting is speculatively helping us with IQ.

### CPU >> Emotional Executive

> TODO: executive control metaphor; fuse Skinnerian operant w/curiosity; The highlighting of detail plays a transitional role (Packer >> Mapper) where the student follows a "formula of paying attention" that applies to any pair of two details (combinatorial explosion = training is more robust). Helps the idea of paying attention to This Thing while being motivated to precommit to One Other Thing.

- root of impulsivity

### GPU >> Cognitive map

- self-organizing cognitive map
- the popular construct of "rationality"
- nonverbal acquisition of first principles
- `systems-analysis.md`
- mental models
- sensory process of visualization; simulating the future from the episodic past/present
- combinatorial generalization >> creative intuition
- principles transclude other principles
- QUOTE ABSTRACT "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560]

### GPU >> Self-regulation

- People need to behave in accordance with a binary signal of rationality (Correct-Incorrect).
- CI represents the local maxima of rationality
- key differences from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
- `self-regulation.md`

### TODO Advanced cognitive languages

```

The student divides up their thought process between the major languages.

- skill generalization
- maturity
- rationality
- To do this, we assume the existence of particular neurological phenomena
- in the end, we can't get "stuck" so we'll have to do this Wartime Mentality capture of value

## Student's Guide

### Outline

1. Imagine both correct and incorrect.
2. SAME-DIFF teaches "exclusionary attention/temporal ping-pong/CI"
3. MORE-LESS teaches "snowballing/curiosity."
4. HIERARCHY teaches "token/locus/painting."

### Principle of surprise (Correct-Incorrect Binary)

- visualize imagining both cases
- On how cognitively surprising the difference between present and memory is, you should judge the correctness

avoid "Packer self-blame" and other conscious/subconscious issues, especially during the metaphor-ization of logical associations

- signs: a "NOT" sign for the NOT relation
- signs: a "LESS" sign for the LESS relation
- bubbles: "A == B" inflates to cause the proliferation of "NOT (A =/= B)" which may subsequently bubble into awareness

qualitiative feelings

- "relearning" the educational constructs that were learned through rote
- productive standardized format of data exchange (SDFT/C)
- Combinations of experiential exercises such as rationality reflection, ACT therapy deliteralization, and Snaps make practicing this shift feel like "downhill sledding."
- The rationality network is far more resilient to stress than the token network; therefore, it buffers the psychological risks of the training.
- everyone has their own viewpoint, and social norms result in particular cases of wildly varying first principles, but the first principles of the first principles are far more similar
- cognitive map is massively organized as a high-dimensional space

### Detail, density, Ebbinghaus asymptote

Detail >> Different appearances encode different levels of detail. (e.g., Cartoony appearance vs. realistic appearance)

- *{Details may be shared between multiple tokens.}

Density >> An item is dense if it is an exemplar case of encoding many details very easily under a single token. For instance, in some training contexts (e.g., spatial-visual), it is trivial to absorb massive detail, such that the speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained) is astoundingly fast compared to the declarative memory schemas, which are notoriously poor in density.

"Ebbinghaus asymptote" >> assume that the present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an asymptotic (virtually infinite detail level) episodic memory. [Ebbinghaus principles of forgetting]

### The temporal ping-pong game

> TODO WARNING! This is insufficient. Density must be deliberate practiced in a particular way.

The training can be simplified into a single game, temporal ping-pong

```
as a portal between Item A and Item B, as a shift of attention.
```

#### Step 1 (fast)

The temporal ping-pong should be between Correct and Incorrect.

- paying attention = Correct
- responding correctly = Correct
- Eventually, it only takes a "1% chance" of a random quiz to get the brain to pay attention.

The portal formula is ```TokenA-ObjectA-RandomDetail & TokenB-ObjectB-RandomDetail```. Token painting = the key cognitive operation.

- creativity (skill generalization)
- quick improvement
- two dense items; be really careful to preserve as much detail as possible, when, say, coloring objects RED and GREEN, almost certainly to result in an informal "artistic line-diagram notation" to annotate their visualizations

Traits of temporal ping-pong

- "mind's eye"
- visualization-synthesis of prior episodic memories

#### Step 2 (slow)

- rigorous work
- channeled into productive intelligence
- Finding easy item & hard item using explicit ampersand (```&```) portal notation >> over a long period increasing the difficulty.
- deliberate practice

portal formulas/

```
- 1A and 1A2B, followed by 1B and 1B2A
- less detailed item PORTAL more detailed item
- A PORTAL AB
- 0 PORTAL 01
- 01 PORTAL 012
- 2 PORTAL 012
```

### Vague description of snowballing

Snowballing is when the student moves from less detail to more detail.

- cumulative nature
- innate curiosity of brain
- series of objects
  - Student practice: practice random-access jumping between a cumulating list of items in a memory palace journey.

```
0
01
012
0123
01234
involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item" that all other objects originate from

Zero
Zero Question
Zero Question Answer
```

### Coping with formulas

```
Logic A > B means that B < A [see: Relational Frame Theory]
You could visualize this as a two-variable equation
Even jumping from "front of flashcard" to "back of flashcard" is a logic formula of Item1 + Item2
```

> TODO: sort this out

- Use imagination to visualize a "variable object" as a sort of Platonic Ideal that all specific objects descend from, such that in a "formula," it becomes possible to substitute specific for general.
- visualized in the head as a "small gray-colored sphere" that can be "colored" depending on the position in the formula
- This is for psychological purposes
  - a confidence in the skill generalization where mastering the logic of variables is equal to mastering logical comparisons between specific objects.
  - a confidence in creativity by the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres
  - a confidence in the ability to jump from one sphere to another sphere independent from the first one
- portal between specific item (one item) and Platonic Ideal (zero item)
  - placing a Platonic ideal (zero item) of universalist generalizability at the top of the object hierarchy

## Constructs and deconstruction

TODO. Try to clarify this as quick as possible because this shouldn't be an advanced concept -- we just have to mention First Principle exaptation and the rest is a matter for the student to deal with.

- construct <> system <> First Principle <> deconstruction

A system is defined in the dictionaries as:

> [Merriam Webster] the act, process, or profession of studying an activity (such as a procedure, a business, or a physiological function) typically by mathematical means in order to define its goals or purposes and to discover operations and procedures for accomplishing them most efficiently
>
> [Google Dictionary] a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a set of principles or procedures according to which something is done; an organized scheme or method.

Speculative applications

> We discuss the nature of creativity, entrepreneurship, UX design, and leadership.

> We hypothesize powerful causal links between inefficient rhetoric and inefficient self-help.

> Self-help community; leadership community; rationality community; etc. >> filling out charts of "what I think could be improved, using this framework." Epistemology Tables to productively cover ground

> based on first principles such as those pertaining to self-identity, personal values, ethics, morality, and life experiences, as well as a general set of first principles generally and arbitrarily applicable to constitute an exciting new hypothetical training system of "polymath creativity."

> First principles are descriptions of the partly innate and partly acquired aspects of the rationality map that rhetoric can convey.

## TODO ADVANCED: Rhetorical privilege

### Motivation

TODO/ Rhetorical privilege is necessary only at a later stage in the training. Make this part of the training timeline.

CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM!!! "unjustified rhetorical privilege" >> NECESSITY of rewrite rhetorical intuitions; rhetorical styles; sense of rhetorical productivity

"Wartime makes it clear who's Mapper and who's Packer." "aggressive" 90% reduction in volume while retaining X% of the "meat"; The higher we can make that X% the higher value there is for society. That is my attitude.

### Outline

- _Wartime Mindset_ argument
- _Tech Entrepreneur_ argument
- _Alien Ship_ argument
- _Steak_ argument >> illustrate the wartime vs. peacetime dialectic
- _Wedding Cake_ argument
  - DP rhetoric
  - ZPS-memory privileged rhetoric ("privileged rhetoric")
  - detail rhetoric
- _Rhetorical Privilege_ argument
- limited resources; difficulty of writing (e.g., the book rhetoric is so fluffy, it wastes hours of talent to produce this stuff)

### Applications

rhetorical momentum as the Code of rhetorical privilege

- TODO: multi-document workflows; First Class Function Stream-Of-Consciousness

What words signify unbounded/bounded rhetorical privilege?

- brainstorming
  - well metaphors
  - MCMM (Mikado Method, Categorization, Mental Model)
- Problem-Solution rhetoric
- Classify-Divide rhetoric
- College admissions essays and tone (crystallization, conversation, verbal tricks, background knowledge, reading genre, etc.)
- Harris moves and intertext [Rewriting: How To Do Things With Texts]
- first principles rhetoric
  - cliches
  - narratives
  - systems analogies

Discuss the `@` notation for rhetorical privilege.

As an exemplar, discuss [Trees, Maps, and Theorems].

### Notation

- A rhetorical push `>>` would be a portal where the portal construct is rhetorically privileged
- A curly bracket notation `{}` would be a portal between the normal outside and privileged inside
- An asterisk `*` or footnote -- suggests a _de facto_ side channel (`*{Footnote}` notation becomes a real possibility)
- TODO: ```@X``` or ```X/ Y``` as rhetorical privilge? (e.g., `problem/ A; solution/ B`)
