## Revised Introduction

Here is the big picture of this essay.

1. Cognitive maps can be represented with simple paradigms like "navigation, painting, and spotlighting" that seem learnable: at least, virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to put work into better organizing one's cognitive map. From here, is it possible to write a cognitive map training curriculum -- with powerful effects on both psychological state and cognitive aptitude?
2. What do cognitive maps tell us about psychopathology versus psychological thriving?
3. Is the prior art of Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in https://raiseyouriq.com fundamentally unworkable?
4. From the cognitive map idea, we can start to talk about "one spatial reference point" versus "many spatial reference points." How can we use this general dichotomy to create a curriculum for education? Could such education change the way people communicate (i.e., rhetoric)?

How can **token painting aptitude** -- productively "painting" **cognitive map** regions with tokens (i.e., **cues**) to reinforce navigation/self-organization of the map -- be trained?

The training is based on a simple attention switch between arbitrary cues and details. The training seems really elementary, but I believe that schoolteachers and the whole education system totally fail to teach this stuff in a rigorous way.

Our training is related to Relational Frame Theory because it vaguely resembles the three fundamental relational frames.

1. SAME-DIFF => temporal ping-pong and Correct-Incorrect.
2. MORE-LESS => snowballing/curiosity.
3. HIERARCHY => cue/painting.

## Revised Training

### Overview

- Science suggests the existence of cognitive maps.
  - QUOTE ABSTRACT "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560]
- The two hypothetical neural circuit constructs are proposed.
  - CPU = Reward and Punishment + operant behavior
  - GPU = Rational Behavior + cognitive map (which accounts for operant behavior) + token painting aptitude
  - It is proposed that the CPU has no real self-regulation capacity: the GPU is what makes us mature humans.
    - The GPU would create a special binary signal of rationality (Correct-Incorrect; a **local maxima** of rationality) that could overwrite Reward and Punishment when trained.
- Somewhere along the line, we become contrarians of mainstream therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.
- Are these real neural circuits, and if so, how much dominance should the CPU have?
  - What if our training philosophy were to force the CPU to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility?
  - How could this be done?
- The CPU stage may be necessary at a very young age to crystallize the token painting aptitude in the GPU.
  - nonverbal acquisition of first principles or mental models
  - a mesh of first principles subconsciously acquired in a particular sequence
- SMART [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training] training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ", is fundamentally unworkable compared to our training.
  - It cognitively stresses the GPU only by repeating the drills hundreds to thousands of times; our training is far more direct.

### Terminology

- Different appearances encode different levels of **detail** when visualized.
  - ```cartoony appearance < realistic appearance```
- A **dense** (opposite of **sparse**) training uses cues that the brain absorbs easily (i.e., many details are easily encoded under a single cue).
  - This frequently occurs in the spatial-visual training context. The speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained) is astoundingly fast.
  - Episodic memory is pretty dense.
  - Declarative memory is notoriously sparse.
- The **Ebbinghaus asymptote** is a common-sense assumption from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.
  - The present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an **asymptotic** (virtually infinite detail level) episodic memory.
  - To be clear, seeing an image and forgetting 90% of episodic detail between second 1 and second 10 (after assuming similar rates and extrapolating) reasonably implies that second 0.01 must be incredibly dense (thousands to millions of details) and that the density of second 0 must be virtually infinite.

### Details

- Sit in a typical room. Select two arbitrary cues (A and B).
- From here, generate two more cues: AB (a visual "merging together" or "melting together" of A/B) and X (anything in the room that isn't A or B).
- Define the **portal** procedure operating over two cues (notation: ```&```).
  - Cues have details, right?
  - Label the cue you should pay attention to as CORRECT.
  - Label the other cue as INCORRECT.
  - Notice the binary nature of the CORRECT-INCORRECT.
  - Follow a cycle.
    - Grab a random detail from the CORRECT cue.
    - Switch the CORRECT and INCORRECT cue around.
- Practice the following portals.
  - ```A&B```
  - ```X&AB```
  - ```AB&A```
  - ```AB&B```
- The following attention-related interferences are stressed.
  - paying attention to a cue vs. paying attention to the details hierarchically encoded within the cue
  - correct vs. incorrect (in particular, better managing any symbolic reasoning involved).
  - not directly specifying which object is Correct versus Incorrect until the last milliseconds and seeing how fast your brain can pay attention / react
  - Cue#1 vs. Cue#2
- Within a portal, there is a **dual pressure** (two cues at once) and a rhythmic shift from one to the other. Each cue is **"snowballing"** from less detail to more cumulative detail
  - an expanding out of the hierarchy of details under each cue
  - There is an associative aspect (what particular memories the cue is closely associated with?)

### Vital tips

- We develop the general skill of labeling items in the cognitive map.
  - The portal symbolizes the skill that is generalized.
  - Episodic memory of Cue A, Episodic memory of Cue B, and Contextual Cue X (episodic memory of non-AB details such as the room, time of day, etc.) are members of the cognitive map.
  - Crowd A of neurons continues to talk to Crowd B and Crowd X resulting in very strong combinatorial interactions.
    - Notice how details are pulled in pairs (one detail from one cue + one detail from another)
    - Does this make the training more robust? I don't know.
- You must set up a temporal rhythm, which is what I call temporal ping-pong.
- Why does the narrow focus of the exercise (only two cues and the details within them) give us a major advantage?
  - The INCORRECT case is very specific, as mentioned in the formula.
  - Two points makes a straight line; navigation is definetly based on straight lines.
    - However, this suggests the importance of also practicing memory palace (method of loci) navigation and visualizing "drawing a curved line across the path."
- What makes this more than reward-and-punishment?
  - To be clear, our exercise goes far beyond merely creating a marginal chance of a "random quiz" to get the brain to pay attention; far beyond a "detail mindfulness habit."
  - The exercise as a whole is a massive _signal booster_ of attention/reward/punishment.
  - There is a strong visualization aspect; I believe the "mind's eye" works by storing the delta between the present and the desired visualization.
    - An alternate explanation is that the "mind's eye" works by fluctuating from past (synthesizing the necessary episodic memories) to present.
    - To be clear, I think the GPU is capable of the sensory process of visualization -- simulating the future from the episodic past/present.
  - There is an incredibly fast density shift from Cue A to Cue B and back.
    - You should have a clear conceptualization that many details are being dropped from the brain during the shifts.
    - I strongly suspect the mechanistic manipulation of a "a back-and-forth brain wave rhythm" like "sitting on a rocking chair."
    - The line-diagram notation (annotating boundaries and curves with lines -- like an artist!) tries to amplify this effect. We are trying to preserve as much detail as possible when the objects are "copied" into some working memory buffer (e.g., I force myself to color the objects RED and GREEN).

### Unorganized tips

Getting the general gist of the exercises is enough for beginners. (I noticed improvement in creativity without implementing even half of these.)

The point is to have a clear plan to graduate from more dense to less dense items by using snowball formulas and other advanced techniques. Otherwise, you are virtually guaranteed to hit one of the many training plateaus, and you probably won't notice.

- Practicing the line of reasoning: if my goal were to label everything incorrectly, and A were correct, labeling A as "correct" is incorrect while labeling A as "incorrect" is correct.
- Ensuring the proper understanding of: CUE equals REWARD AND PUNISH equals PHYSICAL OBJECT equals WRAPPER (for hundreds of details).
  - Creating metaphors for reward, punishment, and the cue-detail relationship, clearly understood to be a hierarchy.
    - one cue, many details
    - details can be associated with other details
    - details have subdetails
    - details can turn into new cues
    - details can be shared between multiple cues
    - etc.
- Start judging correctness on how cognitively surprising the difference between the actual case and the anticipated case is.
- Avoid "Packer self-blame" and other conscious/subconscious issues, especially during the metaphor-ization of logical associations.
  - a "NOT" sign for the NOT relation
  - a "LESS" sign for the LESS relation
  - imagining the bubble that says "NOT (A =/= B)" sprouting from the bubble of "A == B"
- Accept that you will have to "relearn" the educational constructs that you learned through rote.
  - You should start thinking in terms of "KWL charts," "hamburger models of essays," and so on.
- Create a productive standardized format of data exchange.
  - This is discussed at length in the more advanced or TODO sections?
- Combinations of experiential exercises such as rationality reflection, ACT therapy deliteralization, and Snaps make practicing this shift feel like "downhill sledding" -- and it should?
- The rationality network is extremely resilient to stress; therefore, it buffers the psychological risks of the training.
  - social norms result in particular cases of wildly varying first principles, but the first principles of the first principles are far more similar; this is the sense of common human identity
- Follow some clear portal formulas. You should note that this point is further addressed in "snowballs."
  - 1A&1A2B => 1B&1B2A
  - less detailed item & more detailed item
  - etc.
- Use imagination to visualize a "variable object" as a sort of Platonic Ideal that all specific objects descend from
  - portal between specific item (one item) and a small gray-colored sphere that can be colored depending on the position in the formula (zero item)
    - placing a Platonic ideal (zero item) of universalist generalizability at the top of the object hierarchy
    - a confidence in the skill generalization where mastering the logic of variables is equal to mastering logical comparisons between specific objects
    - a confidence in creativity by the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres
    - a confidence in the ability to jump from one sphere to another sphere independent from the first one
- TODO: work out a First Principles-based language learning system? This might really be the next major step in the learning journey.
  - universalizes to foreign languages
  - systems analysis and first principles

Logic A > B means that B < A [see: Relational Frame Theory]
You could visualize this as a two-variable equation
Even jumping from "front of flashcard" to "back of flashcard" is a logic formula of Item1 + Item2

## TODO Analysis of Deliberate Practice

Creativity training: ```Cue >> wait for detail expansion >> detail-as-new-cue1 & detail-as-new-cue2 >> hard output; also, repeat on multiple days to store into short-term memory```

Speed training: ```Cue/detail-as-new-cue OR two unrelated cues >> cue1 & cue2; ```
