Research what other people have written about behaviorism so our presentation of the metaphors won't be trash

Put the most dense material first, because the less dense material is counterintuitively far harder to work with.

1. RFT: A Post-Skinnerian Account; any remotely significant chapters read and take notes
2. The research articles' specific formulation of SMART training
3. What is Multiple Exemplar Training?
4. What is rote learning vs. active learning?
5. What are the taxonomies, Bloom's taxonomy, what is state-of-the-art in active thinking?
6. The research article that tries to defend behaviorism
7. Any material off of the ACBS website
8. Presentations at workshops
9. Weaknesses of behaviorism that other people have written about?
10. Articles about ADHD; https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html
11. Articles about ADHD compared to creativity
12. Material about Valued Action in ACT therapy
13. Material about deliteralization in ACT therapy

Remember the rules

Use documents! Use first principle rhetoric! Use the register (crystallization, conversation, verbal tricks, background knowledge, reading genre, etc.)!

We would probably have several documents.
1. One "practitioner's takeaways" document that contains the kinds of resources that I would use in my day-to-day training (my perspective).
2. One document to add rhetorical "momentum."
3. One document to hit the highlights of the "practitioner's takaways."
4. One document purely as a list of terminologies so that we can categorize them efficiently and track the existing literature.

Criticism of social studies textbook I use. Personally important so I can learn how to cognitively manage it.

An antagonism exists between the textbook's "consistent narrative voice" and the study-notes website (which shows you what students are desperately thirsting for) that merits serious attention.

Study-note websites provide easy memorization outlines, straightforward topic overviews, and challenging test-prep reading comprehension questions. We need to show students how profound and complex history is, and that is what extended excerpts of primary documents are for. Primary documents are cognitively expensive; these narratives carry their insights in the most cognitively expensive and unproductive ways. We need to act against this hyperinflation trend -- this high school pedagogical fashion -- where somehow this fluffiness is OK, where thirty textbook pages are worth hardly three diligent notebook pages.

One sentence from the study-notes website is essentially equal to one or more textbook paragraphs. The textbook creates a slippery sensation of marginally skimmable facts and figures; to gather tiny fragments of the main point, it takes at least two or three jarring back-glances and searches; the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve suggests that >90% of fragments are forgotten in the next 20 minutes and left essentially unreviewed. No college would dream of training their students this way!

What you need to see, though, is that the textbook does teach attention regulation and narrative building in your head. That counts for something if you really learn to see through the cruft and see the First Principles (especially of human interaction) being rolled out, over and over again, the authors rolling out the same red carpet for the same honored guest, Human Interaction First Principles in History. But this is not the DP unless you actively get better at schema building.

> Being able to name a system; "The system of ..."; as a Correct-Incorrect Intent Metaphor (legacy: CIsrm).

> A wide-ranging book e.g., titled "Augmenting the Brain" is a rhetorical trick to cover a ton of ground. We want to illuminate multiple abstraction layers and in fact that easily flows into a deep rhetorical depth.

Construct deconstruction: a major sub-project

- Clarify the construct <> system <> First Principle <> deconstruction relationship

Simplify the training to clarify that the main functional unit is temporal ping-pong painting. This creates the necessary creativity but "channeling" creativity into intelligence is a hugely difficult task. This is why we need the rigor of all this "stuff."

Token deconstruction: a major sub-project

- "Rhetorical privilege" & rhetorical privilege scopes
- Token<>density<>system
- "major" <> rhetorical privilege?
- A rhetorical push ">>" would be a portal "&" where the portal construct is rhetorically privileged
- A curly bracket notation "{}" would be a portal "&" between non-privileged construct and privileged construct
- An asterisk "*" or footnote -- unchanged definition, but can act as a _de facto_ side channel
- *{Footnote} notation becomes a real possibility

Portals

- Portals <> temporal ping-pong. We might want to alter our vocabulary.
- starting from conscious control (temporal ping-pong) ...
- to tokens ...
- to links ... (e.g., a "creative link" between two ideas)
- to densities ...



Narrative: a token is NOT nothing but a locus of conscious control and attention because of the Mapper context it is used in.

Raw data that draws attention (the SDFT in SDCFT) is Packers.

- token-ism
- Turing Tape
- Chinese Room Argument

The dynamism of Code (the C in SDCFT) allows for Mapper.

- creativity (e.g., creativity is a code that "compiles" when we wouldn't expect those SDFT to behave that way just from superficial data input)
- Code means conscious control.

C <> SDFT?

The story of language/society can be told with a single "&" notation. a challenging reconciliation process undergone by practitioners

- Tokens = painting
- Portals = painting games (temporal ping-pong)

Rhetorical Privilege Critique

- Wartime Mindset
- entrepreneur <> tech (~= the "alien ship" metaphor)
- well metaphors ~= MCMM fits very well into the well metaphor
- Wedding Cake argument

ZPS rigor

- tokens
- Painting
- side channel
- The "~=" operator is a portal with a control dialectic of proto-SDCFT language + side channel
- SDCFT as a language where you paint the Turing Tape, memorize the paint.

ZPS <> Rhetorical privilege <> Code (the C in SDCFT)

- ZPS arguments make many instances of rhetorical privilege unjustified, particularly in the popular culture
- ZPS = the universalism that domain skills in fact reduce to a reasonably small number of major stimulus classes with combinatorialist portals
- improves generalizability of the training
- training ... level of training experience
- Here is a list of major stimulus classes that the practitioner would find useful. {privilege/ knowledge isn't necessary in the beginning}
- speculative zero-one rotational symmetry diagram of high-dimensional brain spaces
- One major aspect of the reader is in Wartime where their code resources are limited ... you wouldn't let an arbitrary book invade your precious time unboundedly (e.g., reading front to back at 100wpm when you could skim at 1000wpm). Also, high barrier of entry (e.g., the book rhetoric is so fluffy, it wastes hours of talent to produce this stuff)

Wait ... aren't ~= and <> the same thing? TODO.
