# Systems analysis side note

A system is defined in the dictionaries as:

> [Merriam Webster] the act, process, or profession of studying an activity (such as a procedure, a business, or a physiological function) typically by mathematical means in order to define its goals or purposes and to discover operations and procedures for accomplishing them most efficiently
>
> [Google Dictionary] a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a set of principles or procedures according to which something is done; an organized scheme or method.

As a side note that will be developed later, first principles are the rhetoric of systems analysis.
