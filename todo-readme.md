# Unified set of three rules to increase cognitive intelligence and resolve psychopathology

## Introduction

I came up with the word **"state change"** as an _ad hoc_ category for two psychological behaviors that are similar because I believe they are both driven by a **cognitive map** as the heart of a neural circuit. State changes are seen as a way to stimulate and exercise a generalizable skill of moving between two points on the cognitive map in a "straight line."

## State changes, rational behavior

The first state change involves self-regulation -- training yourself to do the rational behavior.

Let's contrive a two-state training exercise -- a simple hand-motion game where the wrist starts downwards, where flexing the wrist down is (RATIONALLY) INCORRECT and flexing the wrist up is (RATIONALLY) CORRECT.

**We establish rules for the training to be effective.**

1. compare the **detail** _the moment before state change begins vs. the moment a few seconds before that_; mindfully note that state change can occur without any meaningful detail changes in the meantime
2. making the CORRECT behavior intrinsically rewarding
3. swap labels between CORRECT and INCORRECT in a cycle

In the first rule, details can be randomly found in the environment. Reflects how you **don't know when** the cognitive map will trigger the "spontaneous" state changes. I think this is quite effective in fighting the negative thinking that "something must change" before the cognitive map can trigger the INCORRECT to CORRECT state change.

The way that these trainings work, is that I believe that they are a **signal booster** that is more than a mere "detail mindfulness habit." The learning curve: start with hand motions at first. I personally envision the process like using one of the magic wands from _Harry Potter_.

Second rule: What would the intrinsic motivation of rational behavior be?

- Moral intuition?
  - Self-Other relationship?
  - Contentment? Imagination/aliveness of cognitive map?
  - Curiosity? Moving towards the greater good, in a way that transcends a Self-based choice?
- The point of starting with silly games like this is to mimic the various childlike intrinsic rewards of playing a game.

Third rule: Repeatedly practice swapping labels (i.e., the INCORRECT hand flex is changed to be CORRECT and vice versa).

## State changes, attention

We make a paradigm shift in cognitive intelligence.

Cognitive intelligence is the agility of your **"attention soldiers"** -- a mix of veterans (spatiovisual) and newcomers (verbal) who perform the neuron-by-neuron work of cognition.

Whenever the student flicks their attention from Locus A to Locus B and back (creating **state changes**), the soldiers struggle to move between loci in the cognitive map. The invisible and gradual arrival of soldiers has just begun -- ones, tens, hundreds, thousands -- and the more soldiers, the more unstable details can be activated.

You see, value exists in moving more attention soldiers at once.

**Stable** and **unstable** refer to how easily details can be activated. (Spatial-visual memory is notoriously stable, considering the fast speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details, many of which are memorized and retained. Episodic memory is pretty stable. Declarative memory is notoriously unstable. I believe, from extrapolation from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, that the present sensory stream-of-consciousness is equivalent to an episodic memory with virtually infinite stability.)

Example: reading could be trained by cycling attention between two phrases, with **stable** = the words of the phrases; **unstable** = one visual image per phrase.

If there are attention soldiers for memory palaces and other attention soldiers for word processing, maybe the two teams will "blend together" into a big team in the subconscious of the cognitive map. (Perhaps the cognitive map contains a map of all words in the memory that the attention soldiers patrol, and seeing a word makes the attention soldiers rush to that spot.)

**Variations of the state change rules apply.**

1. compare the **stable detail** _throughout the state change_; mindfully note that state change can occur without any meaningful detail changes in the meantine
2. intrinsic reward for naming any **unstable detail** of a CORRECT locus
3. label swap cycle of CORRECT and INCORRECT

Implementation notes.

- The student needs to practice these rules on household objects before moving to abstract ideas.
- Look at your physical environment and pick two loci. The choice of loci should be a stable detail.
  - A.
  - B.
  - Also consider AB; a visual "merging together" or "melting together" of A/B.
  - Also consider X; anything in the room that isn't A or B.
  - Now, select EITHER A & B, or X & AB, or AB & A.
- For all stable details, you need to mindfully/constantly quiz yourself to compare the fact that their presence in the brain doesn't change as attention is shifted. The details will still be present in the field of vision.
  - Repeat things (e.g., visuals, ideas, names, positions) to yourself.
  - Force yourself to "copy" cues into working memory buffers (e.g., I force myself to color the objects RED and GREEN) and imagine that the colors/objects are staying the same.
  - Visually annotate the room with boundaries and curves with lines (like an artist would!) and imagine the lines are staying the same.
  - TODO? Surprisingness training? Deltas should be judged based on how surprising the episodic memory differs from the real memory.
- Label swap the CORRECT and INCORRECT labels, thinking, _if my goal were to label everything incorrectly,_ and A were correct, labeling A as "correct" is incorrect while labeling A as "incorrect" is correct.
- Repeatedly switch at a fast pace, faster than you can find the first unstable detail, such as:
  - locations of particular lines + creative technical description
  - shades of color + creative comparison to some other shade
  - a creative associated memory
- Use a **"temporal ping-pong"** rhythm at a steady pace.

Training advantages.

The fact that there are only two items seems advantageous. Maybe there is the mechanistic manipulation of "back-and-forth brain wave" rhythm. However, a more practical idea is that when there are only two items, there is only one INCORRECT item, such that **label swapping** the meaning of CORRECT and INCORRECT is equivalent to moving to the other locus of attention. In a way, the INCORRECT cue is felt as very specifically and unambiguously **anti-attention** that helps cope with the interferences and makes the rhythm stronger.

- Notice how shifting attention slightly shifts the stability of the details.
  - I believe that the rhythm reflects how visualization works.
    - The **"mind's eye"** rapidly moves from past (the visualization of synthesizing the necessary episodic memories and simulating hypotheticals when necessary) to present (visual appearance of the present).
- Attention-related interferences are stressed
  - paying attention to a cue vs. paying attention to the details hierarchically encoded within the cue
  - correct vs. incorrect (in particular, better managing any symbolic reasoning involved).
  - not directly specifying which object is Correct versus Incorrect until the last milliseconds and seeing how fast your brain can pay attention / react
  - Cue#1 vs. Cue#2
- Cognitive maps are stressed
  - A, B, and X are all episodic memories. They can be thought of as crowds of neurons that talk to each other, resulting in very strong combinatorial interactions -- details are pulled in pairs (jump to Cue#1, pull a detail, jump to Cue#2, pull another detail). Especially with respect to cognitive maps. Does this make the training more robust? I don't know.

## Conclusion

We establish a three-rule framework for productive deliberate practice of self-regulation and cognitive intelligence. Both findings, if scientifically workable, are candidate solutions to major open questions of psychology.

## TODO: more advanced stuff

> TODO? Practice random-access jumping between a cumulating list of items in a memory palace journey. But also a _Random-Access Stress_ in general. This is the best dense construct available ... TODO? This suggests the importance of also practicing memory palace (method of loci) navigation and visualizing "drawing a curved line across the path."

    - bubble metaphors, where "NOT (A not-equals B)" sprouts from "A equals B".
  - **TODO! Figure out how such ideas can be generalized into a productive standardized format of data exchange. Such standardized formats are key to controlling attention.**
- Construct a **cue hierarchy**. Such hierarchies have **zero cues** near the top and **one cues** descending from them. Zero cues are various Platonic Ideals of wide classes of cues (e.g., numbers, letters, words, variables of a logical formula), which should be visualized as small gray-colored spheres as multi-colored parameters of a logical formula, which are eventually substituted for specific objects.
  - Creativity is in part the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres.
  - There frequently exists a need to jump from one sphere to another sphere wholly independent from the first one.
  - The relevant portal formula is: ```0&1```

## Technical notes

- One source claims that "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds."
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560
- Relational Frame Theory is framed in terms of the cognitive map.
  - At a young age, the cognitive map self-organizes through nonverbal acquisition of first principles and mental models.
    - Is the approach of Multiple Exemplar Training in Relational Frame Theory the most efficient? In this light, what do we say about the **prior art** of Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in SMART training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ"? [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training; https://raiseyouriq.com]
    - I think that SMART training supports the hypothesis that **cognitive map stress leads to positive results in cognitive intelligence aptitude increase**. However, is SMART training _efficient_ at cognitive map stress? SMART training takes thousands of repetitions.
    - We claim that not only does our training have fewer repetitions, it fundamentally rewires the brain to rewire itself more effectively. SMART training does not achieve this.
- Our training philosophy directly forces the operant behavior (Reward and Punishment) circuit to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility, in favor of the cognitive map (Rational Behavior) circuit.
  - Do cognitive maps reflect something fundamental in **psychopathology**? At the very least, virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to put work into better organizing one's cognitive map.
