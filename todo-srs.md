# Technical overview of [spaced repetition] [adapted from Wikipedia]

In spaced repetition, strategies are used to organize flashcards by a risk variable in order to optimize for the spacing effect in psychology. Such variables include:

- time the flashcard was introduced
- difficulty of the flashcard
- time since the flashcard was last reviewed
- whether the flashcard was incorrectly answered the last time

A common occurrence in general education is to review cards ad hoc with no clear sense of priority; e.g., a card reviewed last month, if not scheduled during the next couple weeks, may be completely foggy by next month. Spaced repetition creates a positive cycle where memories encoded in the flashcards increase in strength over time.

It is widely accepted that spaced repetition is an essential academic learning strategy, though it is best suited for:
- situations where the learner must be able to remember something for an indefine time frame
- vocabulary acquisition (second language learning)

Most users will adopt a "difficulty metric" (based on how many tries memorizing the card took), a "time metric" (based on when the user schedules the card to be reviewed again), and a "strength metric" (based on how old the card is), where cards are categorized into buckets and the highest risk bucket is virtually always reviewed first.
