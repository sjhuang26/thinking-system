# New ways to train cognitive map aptitudes, increase cognitive intelligence, and cope with psychopathologies

## Introduction

This essay establishes a terminology of **cognitive maps**.

- One source claims that "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds."
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560
- Relational Frame Theory is framed in terms of the cognitive map.
  - At a young age, the cognitive map self-organizes through nonverbal acquisition of first principles and mental models.
    - Is the approach of Multiple Exemplar Training in Relational Frame Theory the most efficient? In this light, what do we say about the **prior art** of Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in SMART training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ"? [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training; https://raiseyouriq.com]
    - I think that SMART training supports the hypothesis that **cognitive map stress leads to positive results in cognitive intelligence aptitude increase**. However, is SMART training _efficient_ at cognitive map stress? SMART training takes thousands of repetitions.
    - We claim that not only does our training have fewer repetitions, it fundamentally rewires the brain to rewire itself more effectively. SMART training does not achieve this.
- Our training philosophy directly forces the operant behavior (Reward and Punishment) circuit to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility, in favor of the cognitive map (Rational Behavior) circuit.
  - Do cognitive maps reflect something fundamental in **psychopathology**? At the very least, virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to put work into better organizing one's cognitive map.

## State changes, rational behavior

A lot of psychology is simply to get people to adopt the rational behavior.

I model rational behavior as **state changes** driven by a cognitive map. Suppose a simple hand-motion game where the wrist starts downwards, where flexing the wrist down is (RATIONALLY) INCORRECT and flexing the wrist up is (RATIONALLY) CORRECT.

If the cognitive map is the heart of a neural circuit that competes against the impulse circuit in making state changes, what could help us make the cognitive map stronger?

I think I have created a worthwhile behavioral intervention with three rules.

1. mindfully compare the **detail** before-and-after, noting that state change can occur without any meaningful detail changes
2. intrinsic reward for making the CORRECT behavior
3. label swap cycle (binary rhythm) of CORRECT and INCORRECT

Implementation notes.

- First rule
  - simply choose random details in the environment
  - reflects how the cognitive map makes "spontaneous" state changes that you **don't know when** they will happen
  - For me, this "surprise factor" has been vital to fight the feeling that "something must change" before the cognitive map can trigger the state change (INCORRECT to CORRECT).
- Second rule
  - reflects how rational behavior is intrinsically rewarding
    - Moral intuition?
    - Self-Other relationship?
      - Contentment -- "Aesthestic sense that makes the cognitive map an alive imagination"?
      - Curiosity -- "Intellectual curiosity more than a Self-based choice"?
  - parallels to a childlike curiosity feeling of playing a game
- Third rule
  - TODO

## State changes, attention

We analyze a cognitive intelligence deliberate practice of quickly cycling attention between two loci. The first and most urgent thing to address is the construct of attention. I reasonably imagine the cognitive map as a navegable high-dimensional space, so when the student moves attention from Locus A to Locus B, this is a **state change** that clearly reflects a point-to-point cognitive map navigation. Now suppose that the movement of attention reflects the movement of ten thousand "attention soldiers." What is the timeline as the attention soldiers wander across? Do all ten thousand make it to Locus B at once, or is it gradual: tens, hundreds, thousands? The more soldiers, the more **unstable detail** is accessible.

The question is now whether the attention-soldiers analogy is valid, because it doesn't take a genius to see the implications for cognitive intelligence training. For instance, reading could be trained by cycling attention between two phrases, with **stable detail** = the words of the phrases; **unstable detail** = one visual image per phrase.

I support this analogy's validity and propose slightly modified versions of state changes.

1. mindfully compare the **stable detail** before-and-after, noting that state change can occur without any meaningful detail changes
2. intrinsic reward for naming any **unstable detail** of a CORRECT locus
3. label swap cycle (binary rhythm) of CORRECT and INCORRECT

- **Stable** and **unstable** refer to how easily details can be activated.
  - Spatial-visual memory is notoriously stable, considering the fast speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details, many of which are memorized and retained.
  - Episodic memory is pretty stable.
  - Declarative memory is notoriously unstable.
  - The **Ebbinghaus asymptote of density** is a common-sense assumption from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve: the present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an episodic memory of **asymptotic (virtually infinite) stability**.

This should be conceptualized as a **signal booster** -- far more than a "detail mindfulness habit" or a "randomized quiz." -- like a "magical wand from _Harry Potter_" that requires deliberate practice to make the most of it. If the first step involves slightly sparse cues, the next step, for the signal booster to be useful, and to avoid severe training plateaus, will be deliberate practice with even sparser cues.

Implementation notes, rule 1.

- Look at your physical environment and pick two loci.
  - A.
  - B.
  - Also consider AB; a visual "merging together" or "melting together" of A/B.
  - Also consider X; anything in the room that isn't A or B.
  - Now, select EITHER A & B, or X & AB, or AB & A.
- Remember to constantly quiz yourself to compare the before-and-after of stable details as attention is shifted.
  - Force yourself to "copy" cues into working memory buffers (e.g., I force myself to color the objects RED and GREEN).
  - Visually annotate the room with boundaries and curves with lines (like an artist would!) -- **line-diagram notation**
  - Repeat things (e.g., visuals, ideas, names, positions) to yourself.
  - TODO? Surprisingness training? Deltas should be judged based on how surprising the episodic memory differs from the real memory.

Unstable details.

- Enforce an **attention binary**.
- Switch the CORRECT and INCORRECT labels. At this time, it is useful to practice the following:
  - _If my goal were to label everything incorrectly,_ and A were correct, labeling A as "correct" is incorrect while labeling A as "incorrect" is correct.
- Repeatedly switch at a fast pace, faster than you can find the first unstable detail.
  - locations of particular lines + creative technical description
  - shades of color + creative comparison to some other shade
  - a creative associated memory
- Use a **"temporal ping-pong"** rhythm at a steady pace.

> TODO! Anything in italics is a sophisticated metaphor/construct that requires further explanation.

Advanced unstable details

- _multiple-document cycle_
- _stream-of-consciousness_
- _garbage collection_: brief periods of waiting
- _forced image consolidation_ (especially in second language acquisition context)
- _group branching_: Correct Group vs. Incorrect Group
- _Thin Client Principle_: virtually anything can be a sparse cue
- _content buffer_: over an extended period of time
- _Krashen Input Hypothesis_: critique

Advanced stable details

- _first principles_
- _systems analysis_
- _legalistic constructs_
- _semi-mnemonics_: applying sparse mnemonics to a dense word-stream

Training advantages.

The fact that there are only two items seems advantageous. Maybe there is the mechanistic manipulation of "back-and-forth brain wave" rhythm. However, a more practical idea is that when there are only two items, there is only one INCORRECT item, such that **label swapping** the meaning of CORRECT and INCORRECT is equivalent to moving to the other locus of attention. In a way, the INCORRECT cue is felt as very specifically and unambiguously **anti-attention** that helps cope with the interferences and makes the rhythm stronger.

- Notice how shifting attention slightly shifts the stability of the details.
  - I believe that the rhythm reflects how visualization works.
    - The **"mind's eye"** rapidly moves from past (the visualization of synthesizing the necessary episodic memories and simulating hypotheticals when necessary) to present (visual appearance of the present).
- Attention-related interferences are stressed
  - paying attention to a cue vs. paying attention to the details hierarchically encoded within the cue
  - correct vs. incorrect (in particular, better managing any symbolic reasoning involved).
  - not directly specifying which object is Correct versus Incorrect until the last milliseconds and seeing how fast your brain can pay attention / react
  - Cue#1 vs. Cue#2
- Cognitive maps are stressed
  - A, B, and X are all episodic memories. They can be thought of as crowds of neurons that talk to each other, resulting in very strong combinatorial interactions -- details are pulled in pairs (jump to Cue#1, pull a detail, jump to Cue#2, pull another detail). Especially with respect to cognitive maps. Does this make the training more robust? I don't know.

## Conclusion

We created a general framework of state changes and provided three rules for their deliberate practice. Part 1 applies to self-regulation, and Part 2 applies to cognitive intelligence.

## TODO: more advanced stuff

> TODO? Practice random-access jumping between a cumulating list of items in a memory palace journey. But also a _Random-Access Stress_ in general. This is the best dense construct available ... TODO? This suggests the importance of also practicing memory palace (method of loci) navigation and visualizing "drawing a curved line across the path."

- At some point you should review basic **educational constructs** that you had learned in the past through rote.
  - "KWL charts"
  - "hamburger models of essays"
  - logical relations and deductions
    - "NOT" metaphor
    - "LESS THAN" and "MORE THAN" metaphors
    - bubble metaphors, where "NOT (A not-equals B)" sprouts from "A equals B".
  - **TODO! Figure out how such ideas can be generalized into a productive standardized format of data exchange. Such standardized formats are key to controlling attention.**
- Construct a **cue hierarchy**. Such hierarchies have **zero cues** near the top and **one cues** descending from them. Zero cues are various Platonic Ideals of wide classes of cues (e.g., numbers, letters, words, variables of a logical formula), which should be visualized as small gray-colored spheres as multi-colored parameters of a logical formula, which are eventually substituted for specific objects.
  - Creativity is in part the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres.
  - There frequently exists a need to jump from one sphere to another sphere wholly independent from the first one.
  - The relevant portal formula is: ```0&1```
