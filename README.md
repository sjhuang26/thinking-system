# New ways to train cognitive map aptitudes, increase cognitive intelligence, and cope with psychopathologies

## Revised Introduction

This essay establishes a terminology of **cognitive maps**.

- One source claims that "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds."
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560
- Relational Frame Theory is framed in terms of the cognitive map.
  - At a young age, the cognitive map self-organizes through nonverbal acquisition of first principles and mental models.
    - Is the approach of Multiple Exemplar Training in Relational Frame Theory the most efficient? In this light, what do we say about the **prior art** of Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in SMART training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ"? [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training; https://raiseyouriq.com]

We outline a major difference between two neural circuits: Reward and Punishment versus Rational Behavior.

Using an analogy to two major classes of computer processors, we call the former the CPU and the latter the GPU.

- First circuit: CPU
  - Reward and punishment / operant behavior
    - primary actor in the CPU
    - emotional impulsivity?
  - Is it reasonable to make a training philosophy designed to force the CPU to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility?
  - The GPU would create a CORRECT-INCORRECT binary signal of rationality that could overwrite the CPU.
    - This is treated as a **local maxima** of rationality.
- Second circuit: GPU
  - Rational behavior / cognitive map
    - primary actor in the GPU
    - accounts for operant behavior
  - token painting aptitude
    - Can a **training curriculum** be developed to increase **token painting aptitude** -- one's productivity in responding to cues by activating the right subset of the details in the cognitive map -- and would this increase cognitive intelligence?
  - self-regulation
    - Do cognitive maps reflect something fundamental in **psychopathology**? At the very least, virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to put work into better organizing one's cognitive map.
    - see the section referring to ```"Snaps": a hand-motion game of self-regulation```
    - comparison to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
    - comparison to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy

### Main takeaway

I think that SMART training supports the hypothesis that **GPU stress leads to positive results in cognitive intelligence aptitude increase**.

However, is SMART training _efficient_ at GPU stress? SMART training takes thousands of repetitions.

We claim that not only does our training have fewer repetitions, it has an advantageous _training timeline_. In ```How to avoid training plateaus?``` we discuss how our training unlocks an _efficient_ process at graduating from **dense** to **sparse** cognitive skills, creating a level of _cognitive control and intuition_ that neither SMART training nor the best prior art in pedagogy does.

> TODO? Discuss the deliberate practice graduation from basic (sparse cues that aren't very sparse) to advanced (very sparse cues) in light of the portal/snowballing/hierarchy terminology as well as the latest notation, Hdense-Hsparse.

## Revised Training

### Terminology

- **Token painting aptitude** is hypothesized to comprise **portaling**, **snowballing**, and **cue-detail painting**.
  - This parallels Relational Frame Theory (same-different; more-less; hierarchy).
- **Snowballing** is accumulating details within a cue, from zero details upwards. When this is trivial, the cue is **dense**; when this is nontrivial, the cue is **sparse**. The "zero details" category includes all details that are so trivial that they don't really count.
  - Spatial-visual memory is notoriously dense, considering the fast speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details, many of which are memorized and retained.
  - Episodic memory is pretty dense.
  - Declarative memory is notoriously sparse.
  - The **Ebbinghaus asymptote of density** is a common-sense assumption from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve: the present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an episodic memory of **asymptotic (virtually infinite) density**. EXAMPLE: seeing an image and forgetting 90% of episodic detail between second 1 and second 10 (after assuming similar rates and extrapolating) reasonably implies that second 0.01 must be incredibly dense (thousands to millions of details) and that the density of second 0 must be virtually infinite.
- The **portal** procedure is a cycle repeated several times to exercise an attention binary, in the end **snowballing** two cues at once.
  - notation: ```Cue#1 & Cue#2```
- The **deliberate practice** procedure will be defined as: treat the situation as one big **dense cue** to **snowball** over (i.e., **dense coping**) in order to obtain two details that are both equivalent to **sparse cues**, which we **portal** between (i.e., **sparse coping**).
  - This should be conceptualized as a **signal booster** -- far more than a "detail mindfulness habit" or a "randomized quiz." -- like a "magical wand from _Harry Potter_" that requires deliberate practice to make the most of it. If the first step involves slightly sparse cues, the next step, for the signal booster to be useful, and to avoid severe training plateaus, will be deliberate practice with even sparser cues.

### Setup of training exercise

**From your physical surroundings, pick two cues (i.e., objects).**

- Cue A.
- Cue B.
- Also consider cue AB.
  - (a visual "merging together" or "melting together" of A/B)
- Also consider cue X.
  - (anything in the room that isn't A or B)

**Notice how the physical surroundings are denser than the cues.**

> TODO: address this later. This is the basic step of the training, as part of a curriculum to move you to sparser and sparser cues. This point is addressed further in ```How to avoid training plateaus? Considerations of deliberate practice.```.

**You will be practicing the following portals.**

- ```A&B```
- ```X&AB```
- ```AB&A```
- ```AB&B```

### Portal procedure

Steps:

1. Set up the **Attention binary**.
  - Label the cue you want to pay attention to as CORRECT. Label the other cue as INCORRECT.
  - In a way, the INCORRECT cue is felt as very specifically and unambiguously **anti-attention**.
2. **Snowball** from the CORRECT cue; details might be:
  - locations of particular lines
  - shades of color
  - any associated memory
  - style of the room
  - time of day
3. Switch the CORRECT and INCORRECT labels. At this time, it is useful to practice the following:
  - _If my goal were to label everything incorrectly,_ and A were correct, labeling A as "correct" is incorrect while labeling A as "incorrect" is correct.
  - _Based on the surprisingness of the difference between actual/anticipated cases_, you should judge CORRECT versus INCORRECT.
  - _The INCORRECT cue is a source of anti-attention_ which helps cope with the interferences and makes the rhythm stronger.
4. Repeat. Make sure to:
  - switch at a fast pace, faster than you can snowball the first detail
  - use a **"temporal ping-pong"** rhythm at a steady pace

### Signal boost 1: Attention-related interferences are stressed

- paying attention to a cue vs. paying attention to the details hierarchically encoded within the cue
- correct vs. incorrect (in particular, better managing any symbolic reasoning involved).
- not directly specifying which object is Correct versus Incorrect until the last milliseconds and seeing how fast your brain can pay attention / react
- Cue#1 vs. Cue#2

### Signal boost 2: Cognitive maps are stressed

- A, B, and X are all episodic memories and also members of the **cognitive map**. They can be thought of as crowds of neurons that talk to each other, resulting in very strong combinatorial interactions.
  - Details are pulled in pairs (jump to Cue#1, pull a detail, jump to Cue#2, pull another detail).
  - Does this make the training more robust? I don't know.
- Attention is moved between two points (which make a straight line!).

### Signal boost 3: mechanistic manipulation of "back-and-forth brain wave" rhythm

- THINK: is there a density shift as attention is shifted, and how much?
- I believe that the rhythm reflects how visualization works.
  - The **"mind's eye"** rapidly moves from past (the visualization of synthesizing the necessary episodic memories and simulating hypotheticals when necessary) to present (visual appearance of the present).

### How to avoid training plateaus? Considerations of deliberate practice.

> TODO! Anything in italics is a sophisticated metaphor/construct that requires further explanation.

- _sparse coping_
  - _rhythm system_
  - _multiple-document cycle_
- _dense coping_
  - _first principles_
  - _systems analysis_
  - _legalistic constructs_
  - _semi-mnemonics_: applying sparse mnemonics to a dense word-stream
- _multiple-document cycle_
  - _stream-of-consciousness_
  - _garbage collection_: brief periods of waiting
  - _forced image consolidation_ (especially in second language acquisition context)
  - _group branching_: Correct Group vs. Incorrect Group
- _Thin Client Principle_: the details of dense cues might be a sparse cue
- a _content buffer_ over an extended period of time
- critique of _Krashen Input Hypothesis_

### How to avoid training plateaus? Misc tips.

- Always take careful measures to **preserve as much detail as possible** as attention shifts around.
  - Force yourself to "copy" cues into working memory buffers (e.g., I force myself to color the objects RED and GREEN).
  - Visually annotate the room with boundaries and curves with lines (like an artist would!) -- **line-diagram notation**
  - Clearly feel that each cue attention shift drops details from the brain.
  - Repeat things (e.g., visuals, ideas, names, positions) to yourself.
- Build the **cue/stimulus equivalence understanding** of how CUE equals REWARD AND PUNISH equals PHYSICAL OBJECT equals WRAPPER (for hundreds of details).
  - Creating metaphors for reward, punishment, and the cue-detail relationship, clearly understood to be a hierarchy.
    - one cue, many details
    - details can be associated with other details
    - details have subdetails
    - details can turn into new cues
    - details can be shared between multiple cues
    - etc.
- At some point you should review basic **educational constructs** that you had learned in the past through rote.
  - "KWL charts"
  - "hamburger models of essays"
  - logical relations and deductions
    - "NOT" metaphor
    - "LESS THAN" and "MORE THAN" metaphors
    - bubble metaphors, where "NOT (A not-equals B)" sprouts from "A equals B".
  - TODO! Figure out how such ideas can be generalized into a productive standardized format of data exchange.
- Practicing constructing a **cue hierarchy**. Such hierarchies have **zero cues** near the top and **one cues** descending from them. Zero cues are various Platonic Ideals of wide classes of cues (e.g., numbers, letters, words, variables of a logical formula), which should be visualized as small gray-colored spheres as multi-colored parameters of a logical formula, which are eventually substituted for specific objects.
  - Creativity is in part the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres.
  - There frequently exists a need to jump from one sphere to another sphere wholly independent from the first one.
  - The relevant portal formula is: ```0&1```
  - **TODO: This is when we come full circle to the prior art -- the ideas of SMART training.**

### TODO: a list of more formulas for snowballing

> TODO? Practice random-access jumping between a cumulating list of items in a memory palace journey. But also a _Random-Access Stress_ in general. This is the best dense construct available ... TODO? This suggests the importance of also practicing memory palace (method of loci) navigation and visualizing "drawing a curved line across the path."

```
A&AB

0 & 01
1 & 2 => 01 & 012
2 & 3 => 012 & 0123
3 & 4 => 0123 & 01234

involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item" that all other objects originate from

Zero & Zero Question
Zero Question & Zero Question Answer

less detailed item & more detailed item
```

```
Logic A > B means that B < A [see: Relational Frame Theory]
You could visualize this as a two-variable equation
Even jumping from "front of flashcard" to "back of flashcard" is a logic formula of Item1 + Item2
```

## "Snaps": a hand-motion game of self-regulation

How can a _hand-motion game_ -- say, waving your hand one way for "yes" and the other way for "no" -- make rational behavior and self-regulation easier? I think the game creates a psychological buffer of rational behavior based on activation/sensitization to a **childlike curiosity of playing games**. Such "behavior games" are dense (trivial); most other behaviors are sparse (nontrivial), but deliberate practice can bridge the gap.

In the case of having the hand stuck in the middle, as you are stuck in what appears to be an infinitely unchanging apathetic state, emphasize how you **don't know when** you'll finally break out. It is impossible to find a signal to differentiate the state of apathy and the state of being _about to act_ within a reasonable amount of reaction time.
