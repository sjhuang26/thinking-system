# TODO

## Research plan

What do other people say about behaviorism?

Put the most dense material first, because the less dense material is counterintuitively far harder to work with (not always? look for exceptions).

1. RFT: A Post-Skinnerian Account; any remotely significant chapters read and take notes
2. The research articles' specific formulation of SMART training
3. What is Multiple Exemplar Training?
4. What is rote learning vs. active learning?
5. What are the taxonomies, Bloom's taxonomy, what is state-of-the-art in active thinking?
6. The research article that tries to defend behaviorism
7. Any material off of the ACBS website
8. Presentations at workshops
9. Weaknesses of behaviorism that other people have written about?
10. Articles about ADHD; https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html
11. Articles about ADHD compared to creativity
12. Material about Valued Action in ACT therapy
13. Material about deliteralization in ACT therapy

We would probably have several documents.

1. One "practitioner's takeaways" document that contains the kinds of resources that I would use in my day-to-day training (my perspective).
2. One document to add rhetorical "momentum."
3. One document to hit the highlights of the "practitioner's takaways."
4. One document purely as a list of terminologies so that we can categorize them efficiently and track the existing literature.

## Criticism of social studies textbook I use.

Personally important so I can learn how to cognitively manage it.

An antagonism exists between the textbook's "consistent narrative voice" and the study-notes website (which shows you what students are desperately thirsting for) that merits serious attention.

Study-note websites provide easy memorization outlines, straightforward topic overviews, and challenging test-prep reading comprehension questions. We need to show students how profound and complex history is, and that is what extended excerpts of primary documents are for. Primary documents are cognitively expensive; these narratives carry their insights in the most cognitively expensive and unproductive ways. We need to act against this hyperinflation trend -- this high school pedagogical fashion -- where somehow this fluffiness is OK, where thirty textbook pages are worth hardly three diligent notebook pages.

One sentence from the study-notes website is essentially equal to one or more textbook paragraphs. The textbook creates a slippery sensation of marginally skimmable facts and figures; to gather tiny fragments of the main point, it takes at least two or three jarring back-glances and searches; the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve suggests that >90% of fragments are forgotten in the next 20 minutes and left essentially unreviewed. No college would dream of training their students this way!

What you need to see, though, is that the textbook does teach attention regulation and narrative building in your head. That counts for something if you really learn to see through the cruft and see the First Principles (especially of human interaction) being rolled out, over and over again, the authors rolling out the same red carpet for the same honored guest, Human Interaction First Principles in History. But this is not the DP unless you actively get better at schema building.

## Genre strategy

- "in media res"? Sales copy should reflect an "in media res" where the reader is in a crucial point in the middle of a long-winded journey

## Rhetorical strategy

Particularly in the introduction and conclusion, writing is about acts of focus. If a cognitive map underlies rhetoric, then such focus is like a hotspot of attention in a complex cognitive map.

- narrow spotlight
- psychologically motivating the reader to think about something
- no proliferating islands of "swamp floaters"
- no meandering
- question/answer
- problem/solution

I decided that "draining the swamp of rhetoric" is easiest with the thin client* formula: ```claim + illustrations of the first principles of what is claimed```**.

*computer science analogy

**There are strong parallels to patents (standardized patent format).

## "Remote switch"

How could strategies similar to temporal ping-pong -- a "remote switch" of attention -- be the only true necessity?

- I decided to introduce Zero Point Symmetry.
- I decided to introduce Density, so we can contextualize the learning curve and the deliberate practice involved. 
- I decided to introduce an ampersand  ```&``` notation for portals, so we can talk about the formulas involved.
  - ```0&01 versus 01&012``` only really matters for low-density work

## TODO Advanced cognitive languages: even more formulas?

```

The student divides up their thought process between the major languages.

ensure a good trajectory

- skill generalization
- maturity
- rationality
- To do this, we assume the existence of particular neurological phenomena
- in the end, we can't get "stuck" so we'll have to do this Wartime Mentality capture of value

Serial Data Full Text / Code
SDFT/C, SDCFT

TODO The computer science data-as-code >> the GPU's-rationality-model includes data/Packers, and the code alters-this-rationality-circuit
The student should master the systems thinking formula
from SDFT (packers) to Code="the system of {SDFT}" (mappers)
The student should imagine that the GPU tries to use rationality to model a Packer
The student should do this in order to get the GPU to "understand CI without the CPU's help"

ZPS (Zero Point Symmetric) / SDFT (Serial Data Full Text) / UX critique
ZPAS (Zero Point Asymmetric) / MCMM (Mikado Method <> deliberate practice; Categorization; Mental Model/the CommonCog formulation) / domains in which you are an expert / address Michael Simmons as a ZPAS, NOT a ZPS -- ZPAS problem/solution, classify/divide vs. the ZPS variations; ZPS notation vs. ZPAS notation? / ZPAS as a combination of sequential accumulation and combinatorial explosion
SDSL (Social Domain Specific Language) / face-recognition primitives (identity issues) / social-relationship-based tones of rhetoric / cultural influences
MPSOC (Mapper Packer Stream-of-Consciousness) / Code as a bridge from Packer to Mapper (self-organization of rationality) / First Class Function Stream-of-Consciousness / energy burn analysis / Snaps abstraction of hypnosis construct / Snaps / Density / Contentment / Curiosity

> TODO: We have a more rigorous "rotational symmetry of attention spotlight" that we need to type up, also, how "far" the attention spotlight shines, also, abstracting the idea of an "attention spotlight" to an "observer reference point that has a statistical bias"

Empirical suggesting of branching >> Between the two extremes of 0 (generalizable) and 1 (nongeneralizable), there is a "top" object and a limited amount of "branches" at the top.

Branching model >> mathematics of high-dimensional brain spaces >> speculative rotational symmetry diagram (Zero Point Symmetry)
- cognitive map is massively organized as a high-dimensional space

- 0 = center, 1 = edges of circle
- `~=` defined as combination of
  - non-side-channel (rotational symmetry around 0 = SDFT (raw absorption/Ebbinghaus-retention of full text and data presented in a simple serial format))
  - side channel (popular culture necessity of Deliberate Practice; the Code of SDCFT) pushed to the outside context
  - TODO fix the side channel setup: SDFT is Packer while Code is mapper!!!

The idea that violations of the languages can lead to (serious?) psychological stress

- TODO/ SDFT violations
  - non-serial presentation
  - ambiguous data-fulltext division

- TODO/ etc. ... let the student figure this out

TODO? Look into garbage collection / stream-of-consciousness.

TODO? Look into forced image consolidation in second language acquisition context

TODO? look into "quantum" variations of Correct/Incorrect.

```

## TODO: Our speculative neural circuits

A mapper will "sit and think" about "collect[ed] information" to "simplify" the "mental map" while a packer lacks command of the aforementioned simplifying process. [https://wiki.c2.com/?MappersVsPackers]

CPU = Packer = Reward and Punishment circuit

GPU = Mapper = Cognitive Map circuit (TODO legacy notation: Rationality Circuit)

Is this terminology useful?

### CPU >> Emotional Executive

> TODO: executive control metaphor; fuse Skinnerian operant w/curiosity; The highlighting of detail plays a transitional role (Packer >> Mapper) where the student follows a "formula of paying attention" that applies to any pair of two details (combinatorial explosion = training is more robust). Helps the idea of paying attention to This Thing while being motivated to precommit to One Other Thing.

### GPU >> Self-regulation

- `self-regulation.md`

> ```{TODO: "rationality module" + "energy system" + "Self-Other Relationship module" + "(TODO: SDSL?)" + "(TODO: ZPAS; "Genius Slave"?) or some other metaphor contra grandioseness" + Packer-Mapper analogy (TODO: MPSOC)} (TODO: Packer >> Mapper)(ZPS) (Mapper-ish; SDFT-ish) ("Single Thin Client" metaphor)```

## Analytical Deliberate Practice

"What really is the difference between training fluid intelligence and training foreign languages?"

Rhetoric as deliberate practice?
