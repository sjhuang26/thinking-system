Research what other people have written about behaviorism so our presentation of the metaphors won't be trash

Put the most dense material first, because the less dense material is counterintuitively far harder to work with.

1. RFT: A Post-Skinnerian Account; any remotely significant chapters read and take notes
2. The research articles' specific formulation of SMART training
3. What is Multiple Exemplar Training?
4. What is rote learning vs. active learning?
5. What are the taxonomies, Bloom's taxonomy, what is state-of-the-art in active thinking?
6. The research article that tries to defend behaviorism
7. Any material off of the ACBS website
8. Presentations at workshops
9. Weaknesses of behaviorism that other people have written about?
