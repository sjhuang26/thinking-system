# Defending the "Mapper-Packer" Dialectic as a Breakthrough Perspective in Applied Psychology

## Revised Introduction

Here is the big picture of this essay.

1. Cognitive maps can be represented with simple paradigms like "navigation, painting, and spotlighting" that seem learnable: at least, virtually everyone is psychologically motivated to put work into better organizing one's cognitive map. From here, is it possible to write a cognitive map training curriculum -- with powerful effects on both psychological state and cognitive aptitude?
2. What do cognitive maps tell us about psychopathology versus psychological thriving?
3. Is the prior art of Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in https://raiseyouriq.com fundamentally unworkable?
4. From the cognitive map idea, we can start to talk about "one spatial reference point" versus "many spatial reference points." How can we use this general dichotomy to create a curriculum for education? Could such education change the way people communicate (i.e., rhetoric)?

How can **token painting aptitude** -- productively "painting" **cognitive map** regions with tokens (i.e., **cues**) to reinforce navigation/self-organization of the map -- be trained?

The training is based on a simple attention switch between arbitrary cues and details. The training seems really elementary, but I believe that schoolteachers and the whole education system totally fail to teach this stuff in a rigorous way.

Our training is related to Relational Frame Theory because it vaguely resembles the three fundamental relational frames.

1. SAME-DIFF => temporal ping-pong and Correct-Incorrect.
2. MORE-LESS => snowballing/curiosity.
3. HIERARCHY => cue/painting.

## Revised Training

### Overview

> TODO? The overview needs some more cleaning up.

The essay addresses two hypothetical neural circuits (computer science analogy). The question is: are these real neural circuits?

- CPU = Reward and Punishment + operant behavior
- GPU = Rational Behavior + cognitive map (which accounts for operant behavior) + token painting aptitude

It is proposed that the human self-regulation capacity rests entirely in the GPU. If so, how much dominance should the CPU have? What if our training philosophy were to force the CPU to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility?

- The GPU would create a special binary signal of rationality (Correct-Incorrect; a **local maxima** of rationality) that could overwrite Reward and Punishment when trained.
- Not sure how this fits with mainstream therapies?
  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy

It is proposed that cognitive maps are a primary actor in the GPU.

- QUOTE ABSTRACT "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560]

Of course, the CPU stage may be necessary at a very young age to crystallize the token painting aptitude in the GPU.
- nonverbal acquisition of first principles or mental models
- a mesh of first principles

#### Prior art

Is SMART [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training] training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ", fundamentally unworkable compared to our training? 

I believe the key principle that SMART training shows us is that **GPU stress leads to positive results**, but also, I believe that SMART training is _inefficient_ at GPU stress. SMART training takes thousands of repetitions and we claim that our training has an advantageous training timeline towards **skill generalization**.

### Terminology

- Different appearances encode different levels of **detail** when visualized.
  - ```cartoony appearance < realistic appearance```
- A **dense** (opposite of **sparse**) training uses cues that the brain absorbs easily (i.e., many details are easily encoded under a single cue).
  - This frequently occurs in the spatial-visual training context. The speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained) is astoundingly fast.
  - Episodic memory is pretty dense.
  - Declarative memory is notoriously sparse.
- The **Ebbinghaus asymptote** is a common-sense assumption from the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.
  - The present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an **asymptotic** (virtually infinite detail level) episodic memory.
  - To be clear, seeing an image and forgetting 90% of episodic detail between second 1 and second 10 (after assuming similar rates and extrapolating) reasonably implies that second 0.01 must be incredibly dense (thousands to millions of details) and that the density of second 0 must be virtually infinite.

### Portals (a general skill of cue labelling): context

The **portal** procedure will be defined as operating over any two cues (notation: ```&```).

Sit in a typical room to set up the exercise. Arbitrarily select:

- Cue A.
- Cue B.
- Also consider cue AB.
  - (a visual "merging together" or "melting together" of A/B)
- Also consider cue X.
  - (anything in the room that isn't A or B)

Practice the following portals.

- ```A&B```
- ```X&AB```
- ```AB&A```
- ```AB&B```

### Portals (a general skill of cue labelling): procedure

The portal procedure is defined as a cycle (repeated several times) in a steady **"temporal ping-pong"** rhythm.

- **CORRECT-INCORRECT** binary of attention.
  - Label the cue you should pay **attention** to as CORRECT. Label the other cue as INCORRECT.
  - Notice how the INCORRECT cue is unambiguously **anti-attention**.
- From the CORRECT cue, find another random associated detail to point out: this is **"snowballing"** from less detail to more cumulative detail.
  - (detail possibilities: locations of particular lines, shades of color, any associated memory, style of the room, time of day, etc.)
- Switch the CORRECT and INCORRECT cue around.

There are two **detail hierarchies** being proliferated at once. This is **dual pressure**.

### Attention-related interferences

The following interferences are stressed.

- paying attention to a cue vs. paying attention to the details hierarchically encoded within the cue
- correct vs. incorrect (in particular, better managing any symbolic reasoning involved).
- not directly specifying which object is Correct versus Incorrect until the last milliseconds and seeing how fast your brain can pay attention / react
- Cue#1 vs. Cue#2

### How does this tie into cognitive maps?

- A, B, and X are all episodic memories and also members of the **cognitive map**.
- Crowd A of neurons continues to talk to Crowd B and Crowd X resulting in very strong combinatorial interactions.
  - Details are pulled in pairs (jump to Cue#1, pull a detail, jump to Cue#2, pull another detail).
  - Does this make the training more robust? I don't know.

### What makes this more than reward-and-punishment?

Why does the narrow focus of the exercise (only two cues and the details within them) give us a major advantage?

- The INCORRECT case is very specific.
- Two points makes a straight line; navigation is definetly based on straight lines.
  - However, this suggests the importance of also practicing memory palace (method of loci) navigation and visualizing "drawing a curved line across the path."

Does our exercise go beyond merely creating a marginal chance of a "random quiz" to get the brain to pay attention? Yes; it is far beyond a "detail mindfulness habit."

- The exercise as a whole is a massive _signal booster_ of attention/reward/punishment.
- There is a strong visualization aspect; I believe the "mind's eye" works by storing the delta between the present and the desired visualization.
  - An alternate explanation is that the "mind's eye" works by fluctuating from past (synthesizing the necessary episodic memories) to present.
  - To be clear, I think the GPU is capable of the sensory process of visualization -- simulating the future from the episodic past/present.
- There is an incredibly fast density shift from Cue A to Cue B and back.
  - You should have a clear conceptualization that many details are being dropped from the brain during the shifts.
  - I strongly suspect the mechanistic manipulation of a "a back-and-forth brain wave rhythm" like "sitting on a rocking chair."
  - The line-diagram notation (annotating boundaries and curves with lines -- like an artist!) tries to amplify this effect. We are trying to preserve as much detail as possible when the objects are "copied" into some working memory buffer (e.g., I force myself to color the objects RED and GREEN).

### How to avoid training plateaus?

Have a clear plan to graduate from dense to sparse training by using deliberate practice.

> TODO. Anything in italics is a sophisticated metaphor/construct that requires further explanation.

Follow a _Thin Client_ cycle.

- Input >> apply a dense construct to discover one detail
  - _first principles_
  - _systems analysis_
  - _legalistic constructs_
- Perform ```(initial cue) & (detail as new cue)```
- sparse output >> input
  - multi-document cycle: _a content buffer over an extended period of time_

### How to avoid training plateaus? TODO: unorganized tips

> TODO. There is no guarantee that any of these are clearly explained. But getting the general gist of the exercises is enough for beginners. (I noticed improvement in creativity without implementing even half of these.)

- Practice the **CORRECT-INCORRECT binary swap**.
  - if my goal were to label everything incorrectly, and A were correct, labeling A as "correct" is incorrect while labeling A as "incorrect" is correct.
- Build the **cue equivalences understanding** of how CUE equals REWARD AND PUNISH equals PHYSICAL OBJECT equals WRAPPER (for hundreds of details).
  - Creating metaphors for reward, punishment, and the cue-detail relationship, clearly understood to be a hierarchy.
    - one cue, many details
    - details can be associated with other details
    - details have subdetails
    - details can turn into new cues
    - details can be shared between multiple cues
    - etc.
- Practice judging correctness based on how **surprising** the difference between the actual case and the anticipated case is.
- Accept that you will have to relearn the **educational constructs** that you learned through rote.
  - You should start thinking in terms of "KWL charts," "hamburger models of essays," and so on.
  - Create metaphors for logical relations and inductions.
    - "NOT" signs
    - "LESS THAN" and "MORE THAN" signs
    - Imagine a bubble that says "NOT (A =/= B)" sprouting from the bubble of "A == B".
  - Create a productive standardized format of data exchange.
    - This is discussed at length in the more advanced or TODO sections?
- Use proper **self-regulation exercises** such as rationality reflection, ACT therapy deliteralization, and Snaps.
  - a feeling that self-regulation is as easy as "downhill sledding"
  - TODO: investigate self-regulation denseness vs. sparseness?
  - TODO: create a comprehensive guide on avoiding "Packer self-blame" and other conscious/subconscious issues?
  - The rationality network is extremely resilient to stress; therefore, it buffers the psychological risks of the training.
    - social norms result in particular cases of wildly varying first principles, but the first principles of the first principles are far more similar; this is the sense of common human identity
- Visualize a **zero cue** which is a small gray-colored sphere that can be colored depending on the position in the formula. Treat it as the top of the **cue hierarchy** -- the Platonic Ideal that all **one cues** (specific cues) descend from.
  - To be clear, the portal formula is: ```0&1```
  - Is mastering the logic of variables equal to mastering logical comparisons between specific objects? Is creativity the metaphorical combinatorial collision of thousands of spheres? Is there a general aptitude of jumping from one sphere to another sphere independent from the first one? The point is to build confidence in the skill generalization.
  - **TODO: This is when we come full circle to the prior art -- the ideas of SMART training -- useful although incomplete.**

## Technical Aspects

### A list of more formulas for "snowballs"

> TODO? Practice random-access jumping between a cumulating list of items in a memory palace journey. But also a _Random-Access Stress_ in general.

```
A&AB

0 & 01
1 & 2 => 01 & 012
2 & 3 => 012 & 0123
3 & 4 => 0123 & 01234

involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item" that all other objects originate from

Zero & Zero Question
Zero Question & Zero Question Answer

less detailed item & more detailed item
```

```
Logic A > B means that B < A [see: Relational Frame Theory]
You could visualize this as a two-variable equation
Even jumping from "front of flashcard" to "back of flashcard" is a logic formula of Item1 + Item2
```
