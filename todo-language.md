Self-Other Relationship

So, does there have to be a relationship between the Self and a transcendent Other that works at all levels?

1. Contentment >> the solidarity of the bond of Self-Other relationship.
2. Curiosity >> the inherent desire to move closer to the Other in a way that is essentially unchosen by the Self (including conventional morality).

The levels of epistemology and ontology would be affected very little to none. However, the frequent moral justification of intellectual curiosity suggests that the abstracted Other should be also given a high level of intellectual curiosity?

Similar to how believing in consciousness might be psychologically necessary, as any other belief would be too morally nihilistic?
