# "Snaps" self-regulation

How can the childlike curiosity of playing games be leveraged as self-regulation?

Our training methodology is based on a hand motion -- say, waving your hand one way for "yes" and the other way for "no" -- that channels a psychological sensitivity to the forces of rational behavior -- the force that applies when the hand is in the middle -- when there is no reliable signal to differentiate between (1) being stuck in an infinitely unchanging state of apathy (2) being ABOUT to act within a reasonable amount of reaction time.

When you finally break the state of apathy, what changes for you to do that? Nothing, right? No sensation is a requirement for you to change.

It's like a child playing a game.

If we say they do it out of sheer curiosity, then perhaps curiosity <=> rational behavior.
