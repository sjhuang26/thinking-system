I advise that the concept of Self-Other Relationship be integrated into the GPU.

1. Contentment >> the solidarity of the bond of Self-Other relationship.
2. Curiosity >> the inherent desire to move closer to the Other in a way that is essentially unchosen by the Self (including conventional morality).

Curiosity, being something actionable, is essentially contained in the GPU. As an important implication, the behavior of morally expensive yet morally legitimate intellectual curiosity obligates a behavior of "privileged religious priority" towards the abstracted Other, as a matter of rational parallelism, although we must note that many technical contexts of epistemology and ontology would be affected very little to none.

Rule R1. Snaps.
Rule R2. Density.
Rule R3. Contentment.
Rule R4. Curiosity.

I define a variation of theism entitled relational theism where psychological rationality needs to incorporate traits of a transcendent Self-Other relationship that works at all levels. This runs along the lines of how believing in consciousness might be psychologically necessary simply because any other belief is too morally nihilistic.
