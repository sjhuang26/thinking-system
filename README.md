## Introduction

A mapper will "sit and think" about "collect[ed] information" to "simplify" the "mental map" while a packer lacks command of the aforementioned simplifying process. [https://wiki.c2.com/?MappersVsPackers]

We rigorize the dichotomy with speculative neurological circuits so we can deconstruct a long list of psychological phenomena (including core ideas in Relational Frame Theory).

- Packer - Reward and Punishment circuit - CPU
- Mapper - Rationality circuit - GPU

The goal is for the CPU to relinquish virtually all of its responsibility (using, for instance, metaphors), so that:

- wide-ranging psychological effects arise
  - We describe a therapy with the advantages of learnability (easy to learn), simplicity (very few elements), productivity (generally faster results).
  - We demonstrate that a Self-Other Relationship is psychologically necessary {pertains to: existential crisis vs. existential fulfillment; morality; religion}.
  - We examine my documentation of the extreme psychological effects that the therapy has produced in me.
- new opportunities for increasing cognitive intelligence appear
  - We develop a new training to cognitively stress the GPU far more.
  - We argue that the prior art [Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in https://raiseyouriq.com] is fundamentally unworkable.
- Limitation: the CPU stage may be necessary at a very young age to crystallize some "cue/token bubbles" in the GPU.
  - TODO: Packers + tokens; Mappers + GPU contains a subsystem of Packers (rhetoric/ reconciliation process???)
  - TODO: token = locus of attention/behavior (Token-locus painting)

We address the prior art (SMART [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training] training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ") by arguging that their training is fundamentally unworkable* in cognitively stressing the GPU.

- *{I think the training (inefficiently) works because repeating the drills hundreds to thousands of times creates a marginal stress on the GPU.}

## Speculative neurological circuits

CPU >> Emotional Executive:

- root of impulsivity

GPU >> Cognitive map:

- self-organizing cognitive map
- the popular construct of "rationality"
- nonverbal acquisition of first principles
- `systems-analysis.md`
- mental models
- sensory process of visualization; simulating the future from the episodic past/present
- combinatorial generalization >> creative intuition
- principles transclude other principles
- QUOTE ABSTRACT "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560]

GPU >> Self-regulation:

- the goal is for behavior to always meet a binary standard of Correct-Incorrect (CI)
- CI represents the local maxima of rationality
- key differences from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
- `self-regulation.md`

## Outline of a VERY BASIC VERSION of the training

1. Imagine both correct and incorrect.
2. Learn a ton of metaphors.
3. SAME-DIFF teaches "exclusionary attention."
4. MORE-LESS teaches "snowballing."
5. HIERARCHY teaches "painting."

### Steps 1/2.

> visualize imagining correctly and then visualize imagining incorrectly. Principle of surprise >> on how cognitively surprising the difference between present and memory is, you should judge the quality of mental recall, instead of doing some habit of operant reinforcement (e.g., self-blame) whether conscious or subconscious

> Educational constructs were learned through rote, requiring you to re-learn a bunch of stuff. For instance, the use of memorizing a "NOT" sign for the NOT relation. A "LESS" sign for the LESS relation. etc. metaphor-ize the relations and other rote understandings; create a productive standardized format of data exchange (Serial Data Code Full Text); base everything off of that home base

> same-different (e.g., hot vs. cold), more-less (e.g., small snowball, big snowball), hierarchy (e.g., zoom in / zoom out)

> for example, in a logic puzzle, the bubble corresponding to "A == B" can be expanded to cause the proliferation of "NOT (A =/= B)" which may subsequently bubble into awareness. This parallels the conventional Relational Frame Theory explanation but does not essentialize the CPU in cognitive thriving.

Portal >> Temporal ping-pong is a game involving a metaphorical portal between two painted items.

TODO Simplify the training to clarify that the main functional unit is temporal ping-pong painting. This creates the necessary creativity but "channeling" creativity into intelligence is a hugely difficult task. This is why we need the rigor of all this "stuff."

> CPU executive control and CPU attention >> GPU attention. The GPU attention is done by threatening yourself to pay attention properly using a "10% chance" of a random quiz.
> > TODO a way to fuse Skinnerian operant w/curiosity; and another great opportunity of temporal ping-pong (Skinnerian frame vs. curiosity frame)

> Also practice cumulating keeping track of items in a memory palace journey, although the density fluctuation is lower (but it is still worth practicing this). Do the Correct-Incorrect exercises over the densities to suppress the CPU's operants.

### Steps 3/4/5.

Detail >> Different appearances encode different levels of detail. (e.g., Cartoony appearance vs. realistic appearance)

- *{Details may be shared between multiple tokens.}

Density >> An item is dense if it is an exemplar case of encoding many details very easily under a single token. For instance, in some training contexts (e.g., spatial-visual), it is trivial to absorb massive detail, such that the speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained) is astoundingly fast compared to the declarative memory schemas, which are notoriously poor in density.

"Ebbinghaus asymptote" >> assume that the present sensory stream-of-consciousness is essentially equivalent to an asymptotic (virtually infinite detail level) episodic memory. [Ebbinghaus principles of forgetting]

Snowballing as: a cumulating sequence from an easy item to a hard item

1. a cumulating series of objects from 0 to 01 to 012, involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item" that all other objects originate from
2. going from Question to Question+Answer

Practical use of "zero item" snowballing*

- The student wants skill generalization
- The student uses a list of major stimulus classes
- The student occasionally portals between specific item and zero item (Platonic ideal of mastery)
- The density of the specific item gets easier over time

e.g., ```(ZPa AND ZPb IS TRUE => ZPb AND ZPa IS TRUE) & (objectA AND objectB IS TRUE => objectB and objectA IS TRUE) [Relational Frame Theory]```

In this specific case, you would imagine that there is this Platonic ideal of the "variable object" (like some generic colored sphere) that you substitute with the real object. The point is that it gives the student an abstract concept of the Platonic ideal. This is not sufficient but it is very helpful. The Platonic ideal has skill generalization where mastering the logic of variables is equal to mastering logical comparisons between specific objects. Also, mastering the collision of two "variable objects" creates this general "creative combination" skill.

- visualized in the head as a "gray sphere" that can be "colored" depending on the formula it's in.
- generalization is frequently combinatorial so practice two-object formulas
- a Platonic ideal of universalist generalizability at the top of the object hierarchy
- Represents an innate curiosity to recall or to pattern-match.

*{We defer discussion of a more formal "Zero Point Symmetry" conceptualization.}

### Student Guide

1. temporal ping-pong constitutes the "mind's eye."
2. temporal ping-pong supports the visualization-synthesis of prior episodic memories.
3. The formula is: temporal ping-pong between ObjectA-RandomDetail & ObjectB-RandomDetail.
4. The highlighting of detail plays a transitional role (Packer >> Mapper) where the student follows a "formula of paying attention" that applies to any pair of two details (combinatorial explosion = training is more robust). Helps the idea of paying attention to This Thing while being motivated to precommit to One Other Thing.
5. "Token painting" >> a major cognitive operation that is the key generalizable skill. The neuron network encodes the details as being encapsulated by the token. The student associates the token with either RED or GREEN.
6. use two dense items in the beginning
7. be really careful to preserve as much detail as possible, when, say, coloring objects RED and GREEN, almost certainly to result in an informal "artistic line-diagram notation" to annotate their visualizations
8. gains should result immediately, and then apply deliberate practice >> Finding easy item & hard item using explicit ampersand (```&```) portal notation >> over a long period increasing the difficulty.

### Easy-hard portals

- 1A and 1A2B, followed by 1B and 1B2A
- less detailed item PORTAL more detailed item
- A PORTAL AB
- 0 PORTAL 01
- 01 PORTAL 012
- 2 PORTAL 012

## Serial Data Full Text vs. Code (SDCFT)

The student should master the systems thinking formula

> from SDFT (packers) to Code="the system of {SDFT}" (mappers)

The student should imagine that the GPU tries to use rationality to model a Packer

> The computer science data-as-code >> Manipulating the GPU through code execution as a Mapper, but also, the GPU, as part of rationality, MODELS data/Packers

The student should use steps 1/2 to fight urges of operants and get Code properly grounded on CI

## TODO Zero Point Symmetry (ZPS)

Empirical suggesting of branching >> Between the two extremes of 0 (generalizable) and 1 (nongeneralizable), there is a "top" object and a limited amount of "branches" at the top.

- loosely tracking the skills of each domain of expertise >> train each major stimulus classes until it is mastered

Branching model >> mathematics of high-dimensional brain spaces >> speculative rotational symmetry diagram

- 0 = center, 1 = edges of circle
- `~=` defined as combination of
  - non-side-channel (rotational symmetry around 0 = SDFT (rote memory and basic repetition))
  - side channel (popular culture necessity of Deliberate Practice; the Code of SDCFT) pushed to the outside context

## Outline of rhetorical privilege

CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM!!! "unjustified rhetorical privilege" >> NECESSITY of rewrite rhetorical intuitions; rhetorical styles; sense of rhetorical productivity

"Wartime makes it clear who's Mapper and who's Packer."

- _Wartime Mindset_ argument
- _Tech Entrepreneur_ argument
- _Alien Ship_ argument
- _Steak_ argument >> illustrate the wartime vs. peacetime dialectic
- _Wedding Cake_ argument
  - DP rhetoric
  - ZPS-memory privileged rhetoric ("privileged rhetoric")
  - detail rhetoric
- _Rhetorical Privilege_ argument
- limited resources; difficulty of writing (e.g., the book rhetoric is so fluffy, it wastes hours of talent to produce this stuff)

## Applications of rhetorical privilege

rhetorical momentum as the Code of rhetorical privilege

- TODO: multi-document workflows; First Class Function Stream-Of-Consciousness

What words signify unbounded/bounded rhetorical privilege?

- brainstorming
  - well metaphors
  - MCMM (Mikado Method, Categorization, Mental Model)
- Problem-Solution rhetoric
- Classify-Divide rhetoric
- College admissions essays and tone (crystallization, conversation, verbal tricks, background knowledge, reading genre, etc.)
- Harris moves and intertext [Rewriting: How To Do Things With Texts]
- first principles rhetoric
  - cliches
  - narratives
  - systems analogies

Discuss the `@` notation for rhetorical privilege.

As an exemplar, discuss [Trees, Maps, and Theorems].

## Notation

TODO add more.

- A rhetorical push `>>` would be a portal where the portal construct is rhetorically privileged
- A curly bracket notation `{}` would be a portal between the normal outside and privileged inside
- An asterisk `*` or footnote -- suggests a _de facto_ side channel (`*{Footnote}` notation becomes a real possibility)

## Constructs and deconstruction

TODO. Try to clarify this as quick as possible because this shouldn't be an advanced concept -- we just have to mention First Principle exaptation and the rest is a matter for the student to deal with.

- construct <> system <> First Principle <> deconstruction

A system is defined in the dictionaries as:

> [Merriam Webster] the act, process, or profession of studying an activity (such as a procedure, a business, or a physiological function) typically by mathematical means in order to define its goals or purposes and to discover operations and procedures for accomplishing them most efficiently
>
> [Google Dictionary] a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a set of principles or procedures according to which something is done; an organized scheme or method.

Speculative applications

> We discuss the nature of creativity, entrepreneurship, UX design, and leadership.

> We hypothesize powerful causal links between inefficient rhetoric and inefficient self-help.

> Self-help community; leadership community; rationality community; etc. >> filling out charts of "what I think could be improved, using this framework." Epistemology Tables to productively cover ground
