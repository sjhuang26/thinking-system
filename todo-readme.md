**"Attention soldiers"**

A mix of veterans (spatiovisual) and newcomers (verbal) who navigate across loci of attention in the cognitive map.

1. The student moves their attention from Locus A to Locus B.
2. Soldiers accumulate in Locus B in ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands.
3. The more soldiers in Locus B, the more **unstable** details can be activated.
4. Spatial-visual memory and episodic memory are considered stable (hierarchy of big/small details). Declarative memory is considered unstable.

## Practice 1

- Find two loci (household objects).
- Pick a detail from Locus A, pick a detail from Locus B, repeat.
- Label swap -- A as CORRECT, B as INCORRECT, then switch CORRECT and INCORRECT.

crowds of neurons -- Crowd A and Crowd B -- very strong combinatorial interactions between pairs of details.
