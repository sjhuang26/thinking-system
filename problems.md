# Every construct that could be problematic

Almost all of this exposes some problematic constructions.

Token deconstruction: a major sub-project

- Token<>density<>system

"Decay factor" vs. level of detail = density

- Density fluctuates. DetailA RandomDetailB has poor density (fast decay) while DetailA RelatedDetailB has good density (slow decay)
- The point is that high-density painting is more efficient
- A higher level of detail will always have faster decay ... but the degree of this effect is density.

Unanswered/ Density seems important, like a global factor, but it seems to have a limited local use at best. So what IS density ABOUT at a first principles level?

TODO WATCH OUT don't essentialize density!!! OR skill generalization!!! OR zero points outside of symmetry!!!

These things do not need to be addressed.

`~=` is a ZPS while `<>` is scoped rhetorical privilege.
