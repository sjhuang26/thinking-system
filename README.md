## Context/ Overview of "mapper-packer" vocabulary

QUOTE { Mapping is the kind of learning you do when, after you pick up some information, you sit and think about it in an effort to simplify the way you think about it (i.e., simplify your mental map). Mappers are the world's great thinkers: they are the inventors, the scientists, those who think and control. Packing is like mapping in that you collect information, but differs from mapping in that you don't have any particular desire to simplify your mental map. Packers are the world's great storehouses of memory: they are the storytellers, the historians, those who memorize and repeat. } [https://wiki.c2.com/?MappersVsPackers]

## Context/ Psychology

We deconstruct a long list of psychological phenomena (including core ideas in Relational Frame Theory) in terms of a two-circuit dichotomy.

- Packer - Reward and Punishment circuit - CPU
- Mapper - Rationality circuit - GPU

The point is to wholly transcend the CPU. We suggest that when the individual shifts to GPU dominance ...

- wide-ranging psychological effects arise
  - We propose a therapeutic training program so that the the CPU can relinquish its responsibilities.
  - We defend the necessity of a GPU-embedded Self-Other Relationship in a psychologically rigorous way, talking about {existential crisis vs. existential fulfillment; moral aspect, religious aspect}.
  - We examine the evidence/ documentation of psychological symptoms that the therapy produces. Qualitatively distinct from previous therapies.
- new opportunities for increasing cognitive intelligence appear
  - We develop a new training that stresses the GPU far more.
  - We argue that the prior art [Multiple Exemplar Training as applied in https://raiseyouriq.com] is in this regard fundamentally unworkable.
- Limitation: the CPU stage may be necessary at a very young age to crystallize some "cue/token bubbles" in the GPU.

To address the prior art, there is vast room for improving the successes of the SMART [Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training] training, currently the "only brain training system scientifically proven to raise IQ"; the problem is simply that the training context insufficiently stresses the GPU.

- Derived relational responding and Multiple Exemplar Training is derisively "rote," but that isn't the main criticism (as most people do arrive at a _true metaphor-based understanding_ of relational logic). 

# Context/ Speculative neurological explanations

CPU >> Emotional Executive:

- root of impulsivity

GPU >> Cognitive map:

- self-organizing cognitive map
- the popular construct of "rationality"
- nonverbal acquisition of first principles
- `systems-analysis.md`
- mental models
- sensory process of visualization; simulating the future from the episodic past/present
- combinatorial generalization >> creative intuition
- principles transclude other principles
- QUOTE ABSTRACT "map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318308560]

GPU >> Self-regulation:

- the goal is for behavior to always meet a binary standard of Correct-Incorrect (CI)
- CI represents the local maxima of rationality
- key differences from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
- `self-regulation.md`

## Outline of a VERY BASIC VERSION of the training

1. Imagine both correct and incorrect.
2. Learn a ton of metaphors.
3. SAME-DIFF teaches "exclusionary attention."
4. MORE-LESS teaches "snowballing."
5. HIERARCHY teaches "painting."

Steps 1/2.

> visualize imagining correctly and then visualize imagining incorrectly. Principle of surprise >> on how cognitively surprising the difference between present and memory is, you should judge the quality of mental recall, instead of doing some habit of operant reinforcement (e.g., self-blame) whether conscious or subconscious

> Educational constructs were learned through rote, requiring you to re-learn a bunch of stuff. For instance, the use of memorizing a "NOT" sign for the NOT relation. A "LESS" sign for the LESS relation. etc. metaphor-ize the relations and other rote understandings; create a productive standardized format of data exchange (Serial Data Code Full Text); base everything off of that home base

> same-different (e.g., hot vs. cold), more-less (e.g., small snowball, big snowball), hierarchy (e.g., zoom in / zoom out)

> for example, in a logic puzzle, the bubble corresponding to "A == B" can be expanded to cause the proliferation of "NOT (A =/= B)" which may subsequently bubble into awareness. This parallels the conventional Relational Frame Theory explanation but does not essentialize the CPU in cognitive thriving.

Steps 3/4/5.

Exclusionary attention as:

1. an interaction between every combinatorial pair of details
2. an interaction between every combinatorial pair of tokens
3. paying attention to This Thing while being precommitted to One Other Thing
4. a temporal ping-pong between Two Things (two tokens, A and B, rapidly bouncing attention between the two)

Snowballing as:

1. a cumulating series of objects from 0 to 01 to 012, involving a generic "NULL" item as a "zero item" that all other objects originate from
2. going from Question to Question+Answer
3. a cumulating sequence of densities

Neuron networks are hierarchies that:

1. are encapsulated by a token
2. can be painted with a color (RED-GREEN)
3. encode variegated details in various densities of detail

Token-details hierarchy as:

1. one token encapsulating many details
2. details as being shared by at least one possible token

Density is acted upon by the Ebbinghaus principles of forgetting.

1. The present sensory stream-of-consciousness is an asymptote of virtually infinite density.
2. Conventional episodic memory is worse.
3. Declarative memory is especially low.

Training context comprises:

1. temporal ping-pong
2. painting two neuron networks (A and B)
3. string together detail within A to detail within B
4. practice using a low-density visualization (easier to switch attention) to offload the difficulty of switching attention from one heavy tree of sensory data to another in a high-density, high-pressure situation (e.g., low-density Control Panel, high-density Present Sensory Data, attention switch capability)

> The input of the present sensory data is equivalent to encoding an extremely strong episodic memory that immediately begins to fade.

> In some training contexts (e.g., spatial-visual), it is trivial to absorb massive densities, such that the speed that the individual hierarchically unpacks big details into little details (many of which are memorized and retained) is astoundingly fast compared to the declarative memory schemas.

> CPU executive control and CPU attention >> GPU attention. The GPU attention is done by threatening yourself to pay attention properly using a "10% chance" of a random quiz.

> This might be the origin of visualization or the "mind's eye": ping pong between Present and Synthesis of Prior Episodic Memories (including the episodic memory of the present).

> At any point in time, there may exist many representations of the same physical object with wildly varying densities.

> Present = high. Far past = low. Question AND answer = high. Question = low. Realism = high. Cartoony appearance that is more encodable or memorable = low. Words = really low. Also practice cumulating keeping track of items in a memory palace journey, although the density fluctuation is lower (but it is still worth practicing this). Do the Correct-Incorrect exercises over the densities to suppress the CPU's operants. Hazy visualization, clear visualization, actually visually seeing the object in the present moment. etc.

> The GPU can do deep-mapping as a density-preserving operation. A strong image (e.g., the Present vision) can be deep-mapped into a strong image of a visualizations (e.g., coloring objects Red/Green/Gray) which can be also encoded in episodic memory. Deep mapping is an important marker of the upper end of the density scale.
